2017-07-25,"I really wanted to love this. I have waited a few months before writing this review so that I could really live with it before giving my feedback. I was excited when I bought it. I am not a fitness person, so I didn't mind the reviews that criticized the accuracy of the step count etc. I got it because I wanted to monitor (give or take) my overall activity, sleep and stress levels. I also dislike the look of the fitbit. I am a working mom, so not super glamorous, but still wanted something pretty to look at. On paper I thought the bellabeat had everything I wanted.First, the pros: I like the fact that you can track you sleep, steps, stress and even your meditation. So the idea of it is good. My favorite is the step tracker.The cons:1) It is much too big. This is much larger than a standard woman's watch. When I carry my son with my arm on which I wear the bellabeat, he complains that it hurts him because it digs in his sides.2) The bracelet it comes with is worthless. I started wearing it and it doesn't close completely so it was falling off everywhere. Even when I wasn't doing anything super active. So I had to buy a bracelet on Etsy, with lobster claws and I didn't love it either. Finally I had to have one specially made that makes it look OK, but still not ideal. Finally the specialty bracelets made for it ended up costing me more than the bellabeat itself.3) The sleep tracker is way off. This was one of the main reasons I got it. I wanted to track my sleep. But I end up having to enter it in manually every day as the tracker does not pick up when I am sleeping - or sometimes picks up that I am sleeping when I am wide awake. I thought I had to enter it  manually the first few weeks to get used to my schedule and then it would start to know my habits, but it still doesn't track my sleep properly after wearing it for 3 months straight.Conclusion, the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because I think the idea of a ""well rounded"" fitness tracker for women is really good. I just think they need to make it much smaller so it can really look like jewelry and of course improve the sleep tracker, and bracelet.",I really wanted to love this.,2
2018-04-16,"I am leaving this feedback as I was previously very pleased with my Leaf.  I started having issues with it several months ago - it was losing data often.  The company replied to my concerns and gave me directions to reset it, which I did - I had to also replace the perfectly good recently replaced battery though.  Well now it will not sync at all, hasn't synced in about a month.  I tried replacing the battery and going through the steps they recommended.  The company is now ignoring my customer service requests and not responding now that my Leaf is completely useless and won't do anything.  I've asked for a replacement and they will not respond to me.  Oh well, it was nice for the 6 months that it worked but I am so disappointed in the outcome and customer service.",Only worked for about 6 months and now I'm receiving no customer service support,1
2017-06-27,"I've been enjoying my Leaf Urban for a few months, now. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! There are a few things I would like her to do that she doesn't... yet... but I'm guessing such improvements are in the works. From reading previous early reviews, the company pays attention to customer feedback and has already added useful updates via the app.To be honest, I chose the Bellabeat Leaf Urban over other similar devices solely based on aesthetics. It's pretty. If I'm going to wear it every day, it may as well be pleasing to look at. I like the weight of it, although for sleeping it sometimes feels a bit much. Not a fan of gold chains, I wear mine on a leather cord around my neck, or on my wrist w/the included bracelet, which I love! Once you get the size set, it's super easy to take on and off.  I've only lost it one time so far, while pulling a sweater off, and it got flung across the room. I've since tightened the strap and problem solved. Hopefully, because I'm really liking my new toy! And I especially like when people say how pretty my ""bracelet"" is and I casually reply that it's actually a fitness tracker;)ACTIVITY: On several different hikes/walks,  I've tested the accuracy against my Endomondo app and my friend's Fitbit. Bella was impressively close considering she doesn't have GPS and those others do. My theory is that as long as I'm moving my body, I'm happy. 400 steps isn't going to be a deal breaker anyway. More importantly, I've realized that setting goals (via the app) enables me to motivate myself to do more. I find myself competing with my own history!My one big complaint: My Leaf has tracked me while driving several hours in traffic, and awarded me 14,000 undeserved steps. I drive a huge bouncy bus for a living, so this isn't a one-time problem. On such drives, I've learned to wear it as a necklace to avoid the miscalculation;( I get it. Movement. BUT I would like to be able to correct/edit the error on the app. Aside from my daily tally being off, my weekly tally (which was a surprise bonus to get in my email!) was also skewed. Maybe they will add that to future updates???SLEEP: I really didn't think I'd use or care much about this function. I was wrong. Just seeing the patterns laid out in front of me really does make me cognizant of how much, or how little, sleep I'm getting. AND I've justified a few naps this month in order to meet my daily sleep goals, haha! Furthermore, there's something to be said for the visual showing how my sleep, activity, meditation, and period all affect my stress levels.MEDITATION: Surprisingly, this may be my favorite feature. I'm not one to sit still, so the thought of meditating doesn't generally enter my mind. Until now. And since I've set a ""2 sessions daily"" goal, I actually will make time to stop and breathe. The shorter 2-3 minute sessions come in handy throughout my busy work days; and my husband even asks for the 10 minute ""Deep Sleep"" before bed. It would be nice to get new meditations every now and then, as I'm already memorizing a few from repetition.STRESS: the jury is still out on this one since there are times I KNOW my stress resistance is at a low, but Bella says I'm fine. It would be nice to have a pulse reading capability to give myself reminders to slow/calm down or just to see what my triggers are.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: Ive honestly been disappointed with the help section on the App. Yes, there are several pre-answered questions, but there isn't a place to type in your own individual question and send it off to Bellabeat's cyber gods for help. Maybe there is and I missed it?? Or hopefully that's in the works, as well.APP: the interface is clean and clear and straight forward. I love that they include Dog Walking and Bikrams Yoga in the activity list, but I'd love to see ""hiking mountains"" in addition to the existing ""hiking cross country"". It's a tiny request.Last, but not least, some people have asked if my Leaf gets text messages, receives calls, or can check emails... THANK GOODNESS, NO. I'm plenty connected enough and I certainly don't need any additional RF waves coursing through my body every second of every day. This was actually another huge selling point in choosing this product. I know progress happens, but I hope future versions continue to offer the opt out models;)All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product again, or to recommend it to all my friends!",Enjoying my new toy,5
2017-11-28,"I am loyal to my Bellabeat Leaf! I bought this a few months ago, and have only gone 2 afternoons without it on. I wear it non-stop, I don't even notice it's there. The tracker is great, if your being a lazy couch-potato, you can set it to where it gently vibrates to remind you to walk around. It wakes me every morning at 6:15, and it's great to have that gentle wake-up.Pro: the battery life. I have owned 2 Fitbits, and I wore both for a period of a few weeks before I stopped. The issues was the batteries, I would take off to charge, and never put them back on. or the would die mid-day and just annoy me. Also the aesthetics, the leaf is down right beautiful. I get so many compliments on it. People think it's jewelry- and I have to say I love the look. I am overall a minimalist who doesn't wear much jewelry, but this complements all my outfits, and literally goes with everything! Low profile- I love this thing, the fitbit was very bulky on my wrist and despite the different bands, always annoyed me while typing and sleeping. The leaf, I don't even notice it's there. The band is leather, and after a week it wore perfectly to me and it's so light, it's like it's not there.Con: The leaf does get stuck in my clothing sometimes, so you want to be careful when removing clothes, especially sweaters. I take it off for Roller Derby- this one is probably not going to affect many people. But I do take it off for derby practice. Given that it's hard and could potentially hurt me if I feel on my wrist, I don't wear it for contact sports. But for yoga, and running, I wear it and don't even notice it's there.Overall- highly recommend. It's beautiful, simple, and elegant. The app works really well, and you only have to check in every 14 days! So if you don't like to get the day to day, you don't have to. Check out their website for more information, but hands down- I love my leaf. It make me think about my health on a life style level, versus how many steps. I now think about how exercise, water, sleep affects my stress and I am learning how to control those things. Great product!",Perfect Tracker for Me!,5
2017-03-13,"I discovered the Bellabeat Leaf in the early days. Back when you had to be on a waiting list to buy one when they'd release them in batches. I eventually was able to stop waiting and was able to finally purchase one on Amazon. I wanted it because it tracked steps, your cycle, sleep and offered meditation options. Most of all it was a very female oriented business. I looked at the FitBit but didn't want the bracelet on my arm all the time, this looked much prettier. However, wearing the Leaf as a bracelet didn't work out for my tiny wrists, the Leaf is just a smidge to big for my comfort. I always wear it clipped to my pants which is the recommended best spot for calculating steps anyway.I'm on my fourth Leaf. In the beginning they had a lot of hiccups. I almost gave up on the product except that their customer service was SO AMAZING. They always responded within 24 hours and were always helpful on getting my Leaf up and running again and when it didn't, they sent me a new one free of charge. Unfortunately, this happened twice as I received two faulty Leaves in their early days. I am now on my fourth because my beloved working Leaf fell off somehow, somewhere and I am addicted at tracking my progress. So this was the time to try out the new design of the Leaf Urban which doesn't disappoint.The app has had many changes and upgrades since the beginning, to include more meditation options and customized activities. I've been enjoying all the updates and seeing where they go!",I always wear it clipped to my pants which is the recommended best spot for calculating steps anyway,5
2017-03-29,"I'm happy with the purchase. Prior to the Leaf, I've used two different Fitbit trackers and I hated the rubber band. And my rose-gold Leaf tracker looks much more like jewelry.Pros: Synching is easy. The app has meditation downloads; some are effective and some are cheesy, but they are a good reminder of what I need more of. I really like the Stress Sensitivity tracker, a feature that calculates steps plus sleep plus meditation. Again, it's common sense, but seeing the percentage climb if I did not sleep enough is a good reminder.Cons: The width of the tracker is thicker than I imagined, so I'm attaching a photo for others to see.I have not had the problem of the tracker falling off, and I have not yet tried wearing it attached to a necklace or clothes. The leather band that comes with it works well and is comfortable.Suggestions for Designers: I wish I could connect with my other fitness buddies. I did enjoy various weekly challenges with friends. Oh, and I LOVE not having to recharge this weekly. Big plus.",I'd buy it again.,4
2017-04-04,"I'd been eyeing this product for a while after I saw an ad on Facebook.  I couldn't really justify paying so much for it when i already had a fitbit.  But the fitbit was starting to really irritate my skin and I wanted something that gave me more options on where to wear it and this seemed to be a great choice.  However, I have to say, it fell short of my expectations.Pros:1. versatility to wear in different ways (bracelet, necklace, or clip)2. is much prettier than any other activity tracker3. syncs to the app much faster than my fitbit4. it helps track your period (no other activity tracker does that, that I'm aware of)Cons:1. the product comes with the double wrap bracelet, but only in S/M, which is too small for me (the large is an additional $24)2. when worn as a necklace, it's a bit heavy and tends to stick to my skin (the backside is flat metal)3. the app won't allow me to choose an earlier time for bed before 9pm (I know that may not be an issue for some, but I get up really early, so I have to go to bed early)4. the alarm is kind of a joke; the device vibrates, but I almost can't feel it and it never wakes me up.  I also have one set to remind me to take my vitamins in the evening and at this point, I have never felt it go off.5. it doesn't seem to log any activity unless its continuous for at least 5 min (no step tracking at all unless it logs activity of 5 min or more)6. the stress tracking doesn't make a whole lot of sense; during the day, I usually feel very stressed at work, but it says I'm stress resistantFor me, the cons far outweigh the pros.  I wish I could have tested this out before I spent over $120.  I definitely would not have bought this.",Disappointing,2
2017-05-28,"I got this for my wife to help her during her recovery from several medical conditions. We wanted it to track her walking, monitor her stress, remind her when she hadn't moved in a while and to record her sleep. Overall, we feel like it's let us down. Here's why:1) It does not appear to be sensitive enough to capture when she is walking. In her condition, she walks slowly but for about half an hour. Only once in the last 2 weeks has it recorded any of her walking and then only 5 minutes of it.2) The stress monitor is not really a stress monitor; it is a measure of your stress sensitivity. Not quite the same thing. We thought it would try to detect when you were getting stressed and let you know that you needed to address your stress.3) It has yet to remind her (that we can tell) that she has been inactive for too long. It turns out that by default this is turned off. Shame on me for not finding that. However, I would think that the default would be set to something like the 4 hour level.This review has forced me to look at the instructions and troubleshooting pages and that has helped. My biggest gripe and warning is that the leaf does not have a great setup routine that helps you understand exactly what you need to set and why. The user's manual is pretty much only useful for changing the battery. You really need to go to their website to understand what it can do and how to set everything for what you need.So, looking back at my review, I think a bit of it is because of our misunderstanding of how to use the leaf and too many assumptions that it had reasonable defaults setup. If you get one, make sure you take the time to go through the webpage to look at how to really customize it.On a side note, both our daughters have one and they like it a lot.",Don't assume the leaf has great defaults out of the box; you need to customize it,3
2017-04-12,"I love it! I spent a lot of time and research on activity trackers, and was *this close* to purchasing the Fitbit Charge 2. However I didn't like the thought of giving up my watch and always having to wear something on my wrist. I love the flexibility of the Leaf options (bracelet, necklace, clip). I've received so many compliments on my ""jewelry"" and enjoy telling people that it's actually an activity tracker designed with women in mind. I adore the guided meditation capabilities, as I've been trying to incorporate mindfulness into my life (and failing miserably, before the Leaf came along). Overall, I couldn't be happier with this new introduction to my life, it's helping me improve my activity level and sense of well-being. If you're on the fence, get it, you won't be disappointed!","Improving my activity level and sense of well-being, I love it!",5
2017-03-14,"I love love this product. It's amazing. I have a decently hectic schedule and this little leaf has been integral in my focusing on self care. A few things that attracted me:1. Design, it's chic and fashionable which works for me2. It can be clipped on clothing, worn as a bracelet or necklace. The versatility there is more than enough for me and it looks beautiful3. It tracks my sleep, I clip mine to my shirt when I go to bed and it keeps track of sleep for me4. Period tracking, no more trying to figure out when I'm getting my period.  Now I have it recorded5. It's such an easy way to focus on self care.I cannot explain how much this little guy does, for the days when my life is hectic remembering to take care of myself goes out the door. But having a reminder to mediate (there these amazing guided meditations that take a few minutes but are incredibly centering), to move and sleep goes a long way. Additionally it lets me know about how susceptible I am to stress during the day and how I can take care of myself. It's worth the price and time to use it, personally I wouldn't go with any other brand. For anyone who wants a little bit more this is the tool to use.",Amazing.,5
2017-06-17,"Leaf urban is as stylish as it is smart, making it my statement piece every single day since I bought it a week ago. I used to wear a Fitbit, which was effective for what it was, but wasn't winning any style points. The only thing the Fitbit did that Leaf doesn't do is to track my heartbeat. However, I'm finding my Leaf to be so much more useful. With the Bellabeat ap that integrates Leaf data, I'm getting feedback on the quality of my meditations, the consistency of my activity throughout the day, and where I am on my monthly cycle. Also, Leaf reminds me to move regularly by giving me a gentle nudge (vibration) at intervals that I set in the ap. Fitbit didn't do any of those things. And really the only time I want to know my heartbeat is when I'm actually running, not when I'm going about my day. My heart rate strap does this for me during those time, so I'm not missing anything and feel I have gained so much more with my Leaf. If you're wondering about whether a move to Leaf is right for you, ask yourself about the utility of the information, how will having the data help me understand my body's needs? The feedback from Leaf and the Bellabeat ap have brought me to a better state of health already. That, and it looks good with anything I'm wearing. My only caution is to mention that it is thicker than many of the photos make it appear; I was surprised by this, but in the end find I don't much mind. I'm including an image here to depict that. Otherwise, I've been extremely happy with my purchase and with the performance of the Leaf.",As stylish as it is smart.,5
2019-10-15,"Once I managed to get the Bellabeat app to talk to the health app which then talk to my diet app, I was very happy. It looks great not like a piece of technology.  It’s accurate against the Pedometer that’s my phone. But what makes a huge difference is I don’t have to put it aside like I do my phone, I could wear it while doing the dishes, the laundry and other obnoxious water involving things. It keeps track it and it never bothers me except the being too still buzz to make me stand and move. I wear it at night to keep track of my sleeping it never gets tangled up or breaks the chain although; I’m getting a spare chain for it just in case. No one knows I’m using Pedometer so I don’t have comments about my weight or my walking And I don’t have those helpful folks suggesting I take a walk with them at lunch, when all I want to do is sit down and read. So it’s very discreet. It has a nice clean modern look.",Discreet and pretty,5
2018-12-12,"Love it! My fitness trainer thought I was wearing jewelry on my wrist the entire time until I told her it's tracking my fitness as well. I like how you can wear this as a bracelet, necklace, or a pin to your business attire. Was easy to install & sync. I haven't taken it in the shower or tub with me just because I'm scared (even though it says waterproof) I don't want to risk it. I like the water intake section. I went out and bought a water bottle with the exact oz amount marked on it so using both that bottle & the leaf I can track if I'm drinking the correct amount or not enough. The sleep tracker is fairly nice I've noticed myself paying more attention to how I sleep because of it. The meditations aren't bad either, but there could be more added & it sucks you can't input when you've mediated in say your yoga class. I also wish they had more under the activities to select. I do bodyflow & body combat they are both 55 mins of serious sweat breaking exercises but you can't put them into the app you have to guess. Example bodyflow is a mix of Tai chi, yoga & pilates so you're left guessing how long in those 55mins you did those exercises. Body combat is mma conditioning, kickboxing, karate, Muay Thai, boxing as other arts that's cardio which is hard to track in the app since it doesn't have all those disciplines. Overall though great concept & love the leaf itself.",Love it,5
2019-05-02,"Just bought this because I wanted something more fashionable than a Fitbit and I don’t wear watches. I’ve tried several different health trackers before ie Fitbit, Apple Watch, and even Motiv. This one so far seems to be doing well as far as tracking. No issues to report right now, but I’ll update again later. I LOVE the LOOK! It’s classy and goes with anything. The band is not leather but more of this elastic plastic. It still looks cute so I have no issues. I really like how gentle it is to remind you to wake up in morning, I feel it, but it’s not annoying. So far, YES, I would recommend if you’re looking for a nicer device to wear to track your steps and or health.",Good tracker and VERY FASHIONABLE,5
2017-03-29,"I got my Bellabeat Leaf Urban about a week ago and I absolutely LOVE it!  I don't need a heavy duty fitness tracker that reads my texts to me, measures heart rate,  etc. While I often thought about getting a Fitbit I didn't like the fact that 1) I could only wear it on my wrist and 2) It wasn't as attractive as I would like since I could only wear it on my wrist.  I had an UpMove, which I really liked because I could clip it on my clothes, or wear it in a wrist band.  It had a roundish shape so it looked like a watch when wearing it.  However the wrist strap broke and I could only wear it as a clip(and the clip cover was bright yellow so I always wore it hidden.The Bellabeat Leaf is great for me!  It measures steps, and has a good variety of pre-programmed activities to enter, and sleep tracking is  must for me.  I  LOVE that it tracks meditation.  This is a practice I definintely need and never make time for.  It is still a challenge, but when I look at my Leaf and app I am reminded to make time for meditation.  I love the versatility of being able to clip it, wear it on my wrist, or as a necklace, and that it is attractive enough to do so.Things I wish it would do that it doesn't/change about it? The ""wood composite"" of the Urban Leaf is more plastic than wood than I thought it would be.  Maybe sync with MyFitness Pal.  I'm not sure how accurate the step measurments are.  I log many more steps in a day when I wear it on my wrist because of the movment of my hand (I wear it on my non-dominant hand).  A water intake tracking function would be nice too.All in all, I'm loving the Leaf, even with the few items mentioned above.",Loving the Leaf Urban,5
2017-08-10,"I'm a teacher and this tracker fits my lifestyle. I got the silver urban and it goes with anything I wear. I wore it as a bracelet and necklace and both times it stayed on me. It reminds me to do meditation and take time out for myself--exercise, drink water, take vitamins, etc. So important when I'm a busybody. I sweat quite a bit and I often wear it while washing my hands or splash my face, and it was just fine. I have irregular cycles, and the app tracks it too. Easy set up: turn on Bluetooth and tap the leaf, and you're good to go! I have the galaxy s7 edge and it paired seamlessly. For those who want more functionality, I would not recommend this, but for basic functions and style, the leaf is hands down the prettiest tracker out there. I'm not supposed to wear jewelry at work, but I can just clip it on and no one notices. Then when I'm out, just wear it as a bracelet or necklace. There's also lots of artists who make custom bead bracelets and turns the leaf into fine jewelry. I am definitely very happy with it.",So discreet and stylish,5
2017-02-28,"UPDATE: I totally figured out how to work with the clasps within a week. Now it is a ""no-brainer"" to put it on every day, and it never falls off.

2017-09-04,"The BellaBeat Leaf Urban is gorgeous and very useful.  I am still using it consistently after a month and I find that it encourages me to move more often and slow down to meditate.  The period tracker is a little off and could use some tweaking but it is a good tool to have when your doctor asks you about your cycle.  The leather band is stylish and works well with any outfit, the only con I have found with it is that it is a cumbersome to put on - I ended up getting a custom elastic band for it so I can just slip it on and off with ease.Prior to purchasing the activity tracker, I had read mixed reviews and almost didn't get it.  The steep priced also almost scared me away from it, but it turns out to be worth it.  I had tried out cheaper activity trackers with the large rubber bands and time displays, the constant recharging and chafing was not fun.","Almost didn't buy it, so glad I did!",5

This piece goes beyond my preconceptions - i'm (for lack of a better term) a tomboy that is hand tied to my phone - any activity wrist tracker would've been completely repetitive to the glued-to-my-hand device....but the leaf showed me that i can choose to not be distracted (this device also introduced me to meditation), it helped me to find more time for relaxation in meditation, and focusing on myself was not a crime. I love that i can wear about it and forget about it when I'm camping - I can just sync it when I get home from my trip. I hope they come out with a swim-able piece soon!!!

The mediation tracker is a GREAT feature there are ao many different mediations to choose from, whatever is stressing you there is a special mediation especially for it!!!

2017-03-28,"My husband refused to buy me a Fitbit because he said it wasn't my style, and I'd use it for a week then stop using it. And so my quest began for a cute, stylish modern fitness tracker that could be worn in corporate America. I found it with Bellabeat and I love it. The app is easy to use, and I love that I don't have to drag my phone along to track my morning jogs. You can also set it to remind you to take medication/vitamins, and to wake you up in the morning. I wear it as a bracelet, and was a little apprehensive about the reviews complaining that the clasp slips. I agree it takes a little getting used to when you first put it on, but I haven't had issues with it coming undone while wearing it. There are lots of holes in the band to ensure your wrist gets a tight fit. I love it and highly recommend Bellabeat.","Beautiful, functional and easy!",5
2017-01-16,"I really enjoy my Leaf! Before this, I had been a FitBit user. However, I always had problems with my FitBit giving me a rash. Although I loved it, I couldn't keep using it. My mom convinced me to try out the Leaf and I really like it! The fitness goals are a lot more low key than FitBit and I don't get a nasty rash. I love that I can wear it as a necklace or a bracelet or even clip it on to my clothes. It's considerably less bulky than my FitBit. I'm pretty small, so I like that it doesn't overwhelm my wrist. I love the meditation feature that reminds me to take a break throughout the day too. Overall, an excellent product with AWESOME customer service.

2017-03-15,"I have to say that I am absolutely thrilled with my new Leaf! I had previously used the Fitbit One that I clipped to my pants. I never bought into any of the other types as I found them so ugly, and I often wear bracelets. The look of the Leaf is perfect, and the urban has gotten me many compliments as a piece of jewelry!As for the functionality, I am very happy with it. The app is easy to use. I love the ability to track not only my steps, but other aspects of my health. I have a daily meditation practice and I love to see the way that may practice contributes to stress reduction. I love the sleep and period tracker, as I am able to have a heads up on when my stress levels will be high, as I can be more proactive on that day.Finally, one of my favorite things about the Leaf is that I don't have to worry about charging it!!I would give the leave a big thumbs up.

The step tracking is accurate and I do like that you can enter in other activities as well.  I would recommend this.

2020-12-26,"This company went WELL out of their way to help me.  I couldn't fix the clasp because of arthritis in my hands, so they made me a one off beaded band that is stretch.  It works perfect and so does the tracker.  I really was impressed with this company.",It works well and the company is impressive!,5
2017-07-14,"If you are expecting a fit bit, this is not it. Specially designed for women and a BALANCED life. It does track activity in many forms as well as sleep, meditation and menstration cycle to arrive at a stress quotient. I love mine! It is attractive and serves the purpose I bought it for. I do recommend that while you can wear it in three different ways, it is most accurate over time if you wear it the same way as often as possible. Also, if you've ever had a fit but or other activity tracking tool, this might take some getting used to. I don't think they work in like fashion.",Love my Urban Leaf!,5
2018-07-31,"THE GOOD:1) I had been looking for an accurate pedometer that was nice and discreet enough to wear to work. This is it! I was impressed when I opened the box, it is beautiful and smaller then I was expecting.2) The step count is very accurate.  I compared it to the Pacer app I have on my phone, and the leaf is more accurate.3)  I also like that you can wear it in different ways, even though I clip it on my pants most of the time. I tried the necklace, looked nice, but i found the metal uncomfortable against my skin. Also, sometimes it gets hot which made me more aware of it near my chest area and I didn't like that. But that's a personal preference.THE BAD:1) The sleep tracker is useless. Basically if you wear the leaf after 9 pm and you happen to be sitting still (like if you are watching TV) it will record this time as sleeping. However if you take a nap before 9 pm is does not record that time and you have to input the nap manually. Other activity trackers monitor you naps automatically. It seems to me that the sleep tracker is not based on your breathing, but it is merely focusing on your movement, and it start tracking this movement only after 9 pm. In my opinion they could have done a better job with this. So I have not been wearing it at night and usually input my sleep manually.If anything, I wish I could deactivate the sleep tracking because every time I sink in the morning I have to fill out the sleep section before I can see anything else, which is time consuming and frankly, kind of annoying.2) When i take it off at night, I wish there was a way to turn it off somehow so It doesn't burn the batteries, but there is no way to do this. It is meant to be worn 24/7 until the battery runs out.3) Step count is the only thing it tracks automatically. Any other activity has to be inserted manually.4) I find the concept of bracelet ridiculous. It is shaped like a watch, occupies as much (and maybe more) space as a watch would ... but it is not a watch, so why would i wear this thing on my wrist? I don't understand the fashion statement.5) I used to have the Inactivity alert set to Level 5 (meaning don't let me rest for longer then 1 hour) but it would vibrate regardless of my activity status, so now I keep it turned off. For example, I came back from an hour walk on Saturday and it started vibrating ... really?6) Period tracker: if you input the start of your period, you also have to enter the last day or it will not know. You pretty much have to enter every single thing you want tracked. I don't like this at all.To sum up, this is a $150 beautiful pedometer. It advertises that it does other things, but truth be told it is a pedometer with some meditation exercises. I find it a little overpriced for a pedometer, but since it was hard enough to find a discreet and accurate pedometer, to me, it is worth it. But I don't think it is an activity tracker.UPDATE 10-9-18I have been wearing it for a few months now and it has definitely loosened up. I don't wear thick clothing or anything (dressed pants, workout pants and jeans). When it becomes loose like this, it can easily fall off, So be careful. I am now looking for something that will help secure it to my pants (which is where you get the most accurate reading). I know I can use the screwdriver disassemble and tighten it when it gets loose, but this is barely a temporary fix ... the second i clip it to my jeans it will loosen up again, so why bother.The real concern is: Why does it have to get loose in the first place? This is yet another design flaw that should have been addressed.Update:1-1-19No longer accurate, so now it’s pretty much useless.Update 6-8-21Have not worned it since my last review. But I recently started a new job where I find myself seating waaaay too much, do I thought I would give it one more try. Unfortunately it stopped working. Contacted customer service and did all the required trouble shooting: Changed the battery, reinstalled the app, unpaired and repaired, but it will not sink anymore. I guess now I have to throw it out... For good.There goes 150$.",Gets loose over time. Stopped working.,1
2017-05-12,"I was so excited to get my Bellabeat two weeks ago, I stayed up late programming it once it came.  I have to say I love this!  It looks like jewelry..... several female co workers saw me wearing it and asked where to get one since they like the concept as well.  The exact steps aren't measured but I look at it as an overall fitness band.  I really love how the app incorporates sleep, meditation, excersise and monthly cycle.  I'm not one for meditating but in the last two weeks I've started to and can tell the difference with my daily life.The only minor down side I have is that the bracelet is too long to wrap once around my wrist but too small to double wrap it. I have it on the very last hook with the slider and at times when I excersice it feels uncomfortable since its snug. Other than that Thus is perfect.",Love my Bellabeat,5
2017-04-04,"When the bellabeat leaf came up in my Pinterest feed, I immediately purchased it!  I work in the fitness industry and I love the idea of including activity, sleep, meditation and mindfulness with the individual's monthly cycle. All of these aspects are necessary to consider to achieve true wellness... and the Leaf does it!  The beautiful presentation as a necklace or bracelet is such an added bonus!  My friends and clients are also falling in love with their Bellabeat products. The Leaf is beautiful and the app is very user friendly.  I special ordered a silver and white cord to wear as the Leaf bracelet, and that has proven to be my favorite way to wear my Leaf. I also like that I do not have to charge the battery.",Love my Leaf,5
2017-07-13,"The bellabeat leaf does everything it promises. I'm wondering if some of the reviewer's on here don't understand how it works or what it was meant for, or just don't know how to use technology and its limitations. It has an intense vibration so much, that I had to pick it  up off of my skin today because the alarm works that well.  Just for fun I took two steps and synced it to see if it recorded and it did.  I also swung it back-and-forth and then synced to see if it falsely read it on my necklace and it did not.  It's not good at recording exactly when I go to bed so I always have to put that in, but you can put in any sleep time and any naptime.  It also shows how well you can manage stress if you've been exercising, sleeping, and meditating correctly.  Which is really cool. I don't always take care of myself and this has already made me more aware and I have been using it only three days! The sync is super fast and I have real data I can work with! Beauty and function meet!  And it's pretty awesome to have some white Ash as these are going to be extinct sometime in the near future due to the emerald ash borer.",Wow,5
2018-03-07,"I love the way the Bellabeat Leaf Urban looks. I usually wear casual clothes, and it goes well with my style of clothing. It would go well with dressier outfits as well. I've had it about a week, and am learning all the features of the app. It was really easy to set up and start using. The only downside I've found so far is that it doesn't automatically detect me riding my exercise bicycle, but thst may be because I wear it on my wrist. (It allows to to enter it manually, though.) For the next week, I'm going to try riding with it clipped to my waistband. Love the guided meditations and stress resistance feature. I wish there was a way to enter blood pressure readings. Pros: Looks, ease of use. Cons: Might not automatically detect certain activities.",A beautiful option for fitness tracking,5
2017-12-12,"I bought this July 28, 2017. I am still loving it. Better than fitbit. I wanted fitbit, but it doesn't match when wearing a dress. This can be a necklace or a bracelet. It use bluetooth to sync both steps and sleep patterns to smart phone app. I also like the app that you can track period, water log for hydration, and meditation. Bellabeat they constantly doing updates on their app, hydration was new. Bellabeat provide products that continues update and improve their functionalities.",Better than fitbit and weare it all the time!,5
2017-05-11,"NO MORE UGLY FITNESS TRACKERS!!!  The Leaf tracker is great alternative to the other trackers on the market.  I love that I can wear it as a bracelet, as a necklace, or attach it to my clothes - which means if I don't want it to be a part of my outfit, no one has to know I have it on. It also makes it easier when doing activities to be able to place somewhere else to prevent damage or it getting dirty.The app is easy to use and it tracks your steps, activity level, miles walked, calories burned, sleep quality, hours slept (and you can add in a nap), meditation, period/pregnancy tracking, and how all of these things effect your overall well-being.  You can set you own fitness, sleep, and meditation goals.  You can also track different types of activities (like dog walking, tennis, sex, running, cleaning, cooking, etc) for an even more accurate calories burned. You can set silent alarms to wake you from sleep or to remind you to get up and walk around.Areas for improvement: I wish there was a meal tracker with calories as well.  It is difficult to know to change the position of the tracker in the app (if you move it from your wrist to your clothes or neck you need to change the location in the app to get accurate results)  I appreciate that you need to do this, but maybe make it an easier option to get to in the app. I think a heartbeat tracker would be nice - but not a deal breaker for me.  I would like to see more accessories available, which may be in the works once they become more popular. Rechargeable battery would also be nice.  I haven't had to change the battery yet... but like my watches, it may take me a while to get new batteries for it. And lastly, It think it a great concept - but what about those fashionable men out there?  I think they would also like a better looking option for fitness tracking.I would recommend this product to my friends and love it - so much better than the other trackers on the market that I have tried and would never buy one of those other trackers again!  They fall apart way too easily and you are stuck with one placement only.  The Leaf is a nice sturdy material with metal brackets, no more plastic stretching, breaking, or bubbling once you sweat in it.",Very happy with my purchase!,5
2021-02-05,So far this has been the most helpful tracker I’ve had. (I’ve had several). For anyone looking for a system to help balance yourself should look into this.

2017-03-28,"I absolutely love my Leaf Urban. I have owned multiple versions of the fitbit, the apple watch and now this and I like it best of all. The two features that set it apart for me are the meditation and the sleep tracker. I didn't have much success with the other items with tracking my sleep because that is when I needed to charge the device. Sleep is an issue for me, so this device has definitely identified patterns. I was never much on meditation prior but since it was on the app, I gave it a try... and found out it does wonders for my day to day life. Another great feature are the options of activity.... I know this sounds silly... but I like that they identify that Soulcycle and cycling are much different lol. Also for someone that is trying to better monitor my cycle, I find this extremely helpful. Overall it's making me pay attention to myself much better than ever before and any other device. I love it. The one thing I would do to improve would be to make the bracelet more secure and easier to latch... this is an everyday struggle for me for some reason.",I absolutely love my Leaf Urban,5

The bracelet was a little challenging to fasten, but now it’s pretty easy. A little concerning is that it unhooked twice while I was wearing it, which was probably due to the way my wrist was positioned. I am a little worried that if this happens without my feeling it, I may lose my leaf urban.There are many positive qualities to this awesome tracker.  It reminds me to move if I sit too long, and I like the fact that I can listen to some meditation exercises to de-stress.  It accurately tracks my steps, and my sleep, and offers feedback on the type of sleep I’ve had.  It syncs to my phone easily, and also to the fitness app pre-installed on my phone.

I can easily wear it with my other jewelry. The app is also easy to use, I can add activity and monitor how much water I drink each day and the quality of my sleep. It works seamlessly with the ihealth app on my iPhone too. I also like the fact that the leaf stores activity information to sync up later on with the app so I don’t have to always have my phone with me and I can manually enter activity if needed. The tutorials on the website are very easy to watch and learn and I like the blogs and how the company participates in supporting better health.

Interacting with the app has encouraged me to meditate (pray in my case) more, walk more, get up from my desk more often. I also started a new exercise routine a few weeks before ordering the Leaf. It's encouraging to see my progress by my steps and calories burned during a workout and keeps me motivated to set new goals.I usually wear my Leaf as a clip (visible or hidden) on my clothes.

Many peoples reviews say that the bracelet was tight or big on wrist, it fit mine perfectly and I have a very small wrist. I haven't use the necklace part yet because I think it looks so cute as a bracelet. Would definitely buy this again.

I was worried that the bracelet would be too small and I'd be cursed to wear it only as a clip on, but low and behold the leather stretches. Woot. What I like most of all about the Bellabeat is that it encourages wellness via meditation, getting more sleep, and being generally more active. The website has good content and allows for you to see your weekly report (fun fact, I definitely get too little sleep). I wouldn't get this if you're training to get to marathon levels, but if you're looking for a great tool to help you pursue a healthier avenue of life, then this is your ticket.",In addition to being easy to use,5

I've enjoyed the way my leaf makes me feel! I enjoy working on my health it's important, but I also like something pretty to help me along my journey. My bellabeat leaf does just that! I work with the airi app in conjunction with the leaf and in the morning my leaf and app give me gentle reminders it's time to start my day. It's beautiful to look at and I get complements on my leaf all the time. It's important to me to work with something I like and keeps me inspired.

The app is clean and easy to use, and the Leaf itself is a striking piece of jewelry. It's simple and pretty and I get compliments all of the time. So far, it's shown accuracy in its tracking abilities; the sleep tracker is spot on, and I'm assuming the step tracker is as well (but it's difficult to know, so I can only compare active days vs less active days, and in that case, it seems to hit the mark). I find  I take more time out to mediate (very happy with the meditation exercises on the app), and I can prepare myself for days when it warns me that I'm likely to stress out.

I've already recommended the Leaf to my friends.",I'm very happy that I did,5

The best part of this, though, is the aesthetic appeal. I get compliments on this all the time from women who just think it's a piece of jewelry. When I tell them it's also a fitness tracker the immediate response is always, ""Wow, that's so much cuter than mine!"" The only thing I wish I could change is the wake-up alarm, it's never strong enough for me to feel it, so I've had to switch back to a phone alarm.

The wrap bracelet takes a little getting used to - the first couple of wears it was awkward to clasp, but it is comfortable and the tracker is really lightweight.

It’s chunky jewelry on me and if it were smaller it would get 6 stars from me.,Great product,5
2017-02-16,Let me start with the fact that this is a stunning piece of technology. I like being able to track my cycle and knowing when I'm fertile so that I can plan for a family in the future. It's smart enough that it can tell me when I was sleeping without me having to tell it which is so much nicer than my fitbit one.  I think it would be really cool if they use that technology to also track breathing and poles so that you can actually track how stressed you are and how your body is reacting to that.

I did lots of research, read reviews, and came to conclusion that the Leaf Urban was my ticket to knowing how many steps I've taken, if I've slept well, and as an added bonus -- have something that encouraged me to take time for myself to simply sit and meditate.I've been more than pleased with how the Bellabeat fits, what it looks like, and how it records my activity in a very simple way. If you want something that gently enters your world, this is the tracker for you.",... electronic reminder to read a text or check email like some of the fitness trackers encourage you to do,5
2017-07-04,"I could not be happier with the purchase of the leaf. I previously owner a fitbit and found the tracking with completely inaccurate whereas this does a much better job. I also like the added feature of tracking my stress levels, ovulation/menstral cycles, and having guided meditation right at my finger tips.",Perfect in every way!,5
2017-04-15,"I have only had my leaf for a little while but I already really enjoy it. I love the amount of detailed data the leaf tracks including steps, sleep and overall calories. I have not used the period tracking yet but I'm looking forward to using this feature in the future.",Love the leaf,5
2018-05-26,"Love this fitness tracker! I already had the Leaf Nature, but wanted a tracker that was water resistant for when I’m active. I wear it hiking and paddle boarding, and so far no problems! I also like the app, and the fact that I can track water, meditating, sleep, and my menstrual cycles. Very happy with my purchase!",Love this fitness tracker,5
2017-02-28,"I also ordered my Leaf from Amazon because of Prime (I got it in 2 days).  I uad some trouble with the initial sync, because I have a Samsung Galaxy S6, which is one of the few devices that struggle with that.  I took out the Leaf's battery and started over, and everything worked from there.  I've had the Leaf for about a week, and I love it! I love the stress tracker, and how it takes into account the effects of sleep, exercise, meditation and even your cycle to track your stress levels.  I also find it handy that you can track your cycle.  And of course, the Leaf Urban is super cute to wear, and conveniently has several options for how to wear it :)",Love my Leaf!,5
2018-06-13,"I love all of the features and for me, it is pretty accurate as to recording everything. Adding in the water is something I need to remember but the meditations are my way of falling asleep each night. I regularly receive compliments as to it's appearance and style. Best purchase!",What you need in style and function for a fitness tracker,5
2017-03-22,"I love the Leaf!  First of all, it's both nice to show off and easy to hide.  I often keep it on my bra so it's completely invisible.  The necklace is also nice.  I'm not great at wearing bracelets, so I actually haven't worn it that way yet.  I also sleep with it attached to my shirt collar and exercise with it either on my pants' band.  It's very secure no matter how I've worn it!It is pretty accurate at recording my sleep and steps, but my favorite part is how it predicts how sensitive I am to stress based on the time of the month, sleep, exercise, and meditation.  If I have a high day, I can make a point to do what I can to lower the percentage (more sleep, more exercise, or meditate) and all of those things do help, so it makes me feel more in control of my emotional health.  It's not really telling me too much I don't already know or couldn't track another way, but just recording everything in one place, tracking patterns, and seeing all of the wellness factors recorded makes me more aware of my choices.  I also like that it tracks my period and ovulation.  Again, information I could keep track of elsewhere, but nice to have recorded and easy to access.",Love it!,5
2017-03-06,"I've tried a variety of health trackers, including the original Jawbones and several varieties of fitbit. The Bellabeat Leaf has some of the features those have, has some features that are all it's own, and lacks other typical fitness tracker features. For me, its utility falls somewhere in the middle of those, and can be either great or not depending on what you want.It does NOT have HR tracking, so if you feel you need that, just move on.Personally, I ordered this because I wanted a tracker that I was not forced to wear on my wrist, that was visually pleasing, and that would sleep track. Some of the other health trackers had sleep tracking, but either the wristband annoyed me in my sleep, or the HR tracking LEDs would flash in my face and wake me in the middle of the night. With the Leaf, I can just clip it on my pajamas, or even on my pillowcase, and it tracks my sleep just fine!None of the fitness trackers I tried included period tracking, which is something I greatly appreciate about the software that goes with the Bellabeat Leaf. It seems like a small thing, but it's nice to not have to mark my calendar with red x's. It also uses the information you give it about when you start and stop your periods to estimate ovulation and the window of greatest fertility. I'm not, personally, trying to get pregnant, but I can see how that would be a fantastic resource for couples who are (or who aren't, for that matter!).","Reasonable tracker, very pretty, some female-centric features",5
2017-03-28,"I've had my leaf urban for about 2 weeks now. It shipped quickly through amazon (prime member). The packaging is very aestethicly pleasing, and I like the look of the leaf and it's accessories. I've worn it in various positions, bracelet necklace clip on. It seems to sense more steps than the steps on my iPhone but there are probably various factors that go into the discrepancies. While I was wearing it on my wrist, it tracked about 1,000 steps when I was teaching a class. This was probably because I teach music and was waving my arms around, so I guess it counted it as steps? Sleeping got a bit messed up when it was a bracelet and has gotten better after switching to clip on pants as suggested. Overall pleased!",Overall quality product,5
2017-03-30,"I received the rose gold Leaf Urban health tracker as a gift from my husband about 2 months ago. It has been fantastic! I love being able to see my activity add up as the day goes on. The features in the app encourage healthy goal-setting--for example, reaching activity goals earlier in the day, 8 hours of sleep a night, and meditation to calm down a bit. We as women often don't listen to our bodies, and this has been a life-altering tool that has changed the way I pay attention to my own body and care for myself through healthy activity, understanding my cycle, and taking time to refocus and use the meditation tool. The only thing that I would suggest is the ability to start an activity on the app and record movements for that particular activity until it stops--for example, I cycle to work and would love to record that as it happens, not afterwards.Besides the function, the Leaf Urban is the most beautiful fitness tracker I've ever seen--it looks like an accessory! It can be worn several different ways--I usually wear it as a necklace or bracelet, but it can also be worn on clothing as a clip (maybe for vigorous activity or breathing exercises). I have small wrists, but the adjustable wrap-around strap fits my wrist perfectly!I HIGHLY recommend it!",It has been fantastic! I love being able to see my activity ...,5
2017-02-05,"The Leaf itself is beautifully designed, a piece of jewelry that is both elegant and modern, and many of my friends have noticed it and asked me about it :) Here's what else I love about it:-it is lightweight (size and weight are comparable to Apple Watch) and doesn't get in the way when exercising or doing yoga inversions (stays securely put as a clip)-I love the guided breathing and meditations within the app, they are beginner-friendly-the alarms are useful, and I use them for gently waking up before my actual ""loud"" alarm clock rings, and to take my pills, the vibrations are gentle and non-intrusive- not having to charge it is a really big plus when we have to charge so many devices these days!The only downside would be that it is hard to clip the Leaf to the clothes (even though once you do it, it stays put and doesn't slide anywhere).One advice for wearing the Leaf as a bracelet: the holes on the strap are really tiny and tight, so I would suggest picking the right hole for your wrist size, and then working the little metal knob in and out of the hole a couple of times to expand it a bit BEFORE actually trying to wrap it around the arm for the first time. Trust me, a little effort goes a long way.All in all, I am really satisfied with this product, beats every other fitness device because it has women in mind!",Gorgeous!,5
2018-01-04,"I am very pleased with my Leaf Urban. My friends have complimented me on my new necklace. They didn’t know it was an activity tracker! It is simple to set up, and the support is fantastic. I also really enjoy their emails. I’d wanted one for a long time, and I’m very happy with my purchase.",No nickel allergy problems here!,5
2017-07-21,I knew I wanted a tracker that looked more like a stylish accessory and this one is perfect. I wear it as a bracelet all day and night. It's definitely keeping me motivated to get more steps and I've started using the mediation apps as well. I've had it about 2 months now and no complaints. Synching has been easy and the sleep tracker seems to be spot-on.  I have a small wrist but I think it looks fine.,Good looking and effective tracker,5
2017-04-11,"The Leaf Urban by Bellabeat was one of the best purchases I've made. I wanted an accurate health tracker, and I didn't need the extra stuff or to spend the price that comes with an Apple Watch. I love that the bellabeat leaf can be worn as a bracelet, clip or necklace, because that allows me to wear it for all of my physical activities. It is very accurate and very easy to use, and I just love it! I also love that it is pretty. If you're looking to buy an accurate health tracker, the Bella beat is an excellent option.",I love it!,5
2017-08-28,"I absolutely love my leaf!Pros: Able to wear various ways, syncs to my phone easily, tracks my steps, sleep and my period, allows me to meditate to reduce my stress and tracks it.Cons: Sometimes it falls off my pants when I go to the bathroom - I just need to find a better way to clip it on.",Love my Leaf!,5
2017-03-14,Really happy with the style of this tracker. Have had lots of compliments on it and can wear it even when I'm dressed up. Love that it has a replaceable battery and I don't have to be bothered with recharging it. The app is user friendly and the guided meditation options are fantastic!,Love this activity tracker!,5
2017-03-15,"Love the style of the Leaf. I wanted a fitness tracker but did not want the bulky ugly band that most of them are. The app was easy to set up and sync, and keeps track of everything I wanted. It tracks steps, active time, distance, calories, sleep, and even meditation and stress level. And I really like that it can be worn as a bracelet, a necklace, or a clip. I am looking forward to using my new leaf to stay active, healthy, and motivated.",Love my new Leaf,5
2017-02-22,"I got my Bellebeat Urban Leaf recently and I already love it so much! A must have for woman, so innovative and motivates me to get up and move more (and take a break!). Super product, the best of trackers and so versatile, the functions I've tested are accurate and the meditation does help one to just take a breather when you need it most. I've had a previous well known brand tracker and the quality was definitely not remotely this good. Love my Bellabeat Urban Leaf!",Must have fitness tracker for (all) woman,5
2017-02-19,"So this was a Valentines gift for my fiancee, who never wants anything so when she wanted this I was like"" I need to buy this!"", and so far she loves it. What do you get for the girl who doesn't like chocolate and works in the floral industry? Jewelry! What kind of jewelry? Whatever kind that grabs her eye.So first and foremost I have to say the look of this is fantastic. It isn't the usual super boring plastic band that every other health tracker is! This is jewelry, that happens to have additional benefits of health & sleep tracking. She wears it everyday and has gotten compliments on it already.Now as a health tracker it works better as a bracelet than a necklace, but that could just be how it works for her. She is super excited about the fact it has the sleep tracking option also, this is her favorite part....well second favorite the look and style are her favorite part. It lets her see how much or how little sleep she gets.",So far the best Valentines gift I have given.,5
2017-03-27,"I am absolutely loving my Leaf Urban tracker. I'm going on my 3rd week of using it and it's great. I didn't want a tracker that looked like I was  wearing one and similar to everyone else. I like I can wear this either as a bracelet or a necklace.This was purchased to replace an UP3 band which looked more like a bracelet than a tracker. I wanted something with the same functionality and features as the UP3. I was a little hesitant as I didn't see prongs or some type of mechanism sticking out on the back. The sleep tracker is important to me as I do quite a bit of international business travel which can affect everything. The activity time tracker is accurate as it coincides with the timing on the various beachbody workouts I do. I have to say the meditation, stress, & menstrual tracker are added bonuses for me especially the first 2 when dealing with customs and TSA. I also enjoy the fact I don't have to continuously charge it every 4-5 days.My only inconvenience and it is a very minor one is not having automatic syncing/updating but then again I am using Samsung Note 4. I was able to delete a few apps from my phone since the Leaf Urban has it (meditation app & menstrual/ovulation app).Overall I truly enjoy Leaf Urban as it works well as a tracker, does what it says, and tailored for women while maintaining it's feminine look.",Beautiful and Functional,5
2017-03-22,"I really love my leaf urban! It looks great, it tracks my steps, and I love that it let's me know how little I'm moving, or how much. I really love the sleep tracker and I keep up with my meditation because I am always trying to reach my goal. Other women have asked me about it and I keep recommending it.",Love my urban leaf!,5
2017-02-10,"I was worried after reading so many reviews about inaccurate step tracking, but I find that mine is consistent in step tracking.  I like the stylish look as well as the variety of ways it can be worn.  I enjoy the meditation downloads and feel that this has inspired me to spend some time meditating.",Absolutely perfect.,5
2017-03-30,"I've enjoyed this tracker so far.  It fits nicely and looks great.  I haven't used for long so can't speak to the accuracy or the value of the elements it tracks, but I was drawn to it for the wellness tracking features so am excited to see the information it tracks.My only complaint so far is when the wrist band is not snug and sometimes for me uncomfortably so the leaf has come unattached.",I've enjoyed this tracker so far,5
2017-03-14,"I love my new Bellabeat! I got it in rose gold and I think it's beautiful! I really like the black leather band. It looks stylish and not at all clunky like some others. Haven't yet used the enclosed chain to make it a necklace or as a clip but will sometime. Just enjoying the bracelet! I'm not all that tech savvy but I had no problem linking it to my I Phone. It couldn't be easier to double tap the Bellabeat to sync the info for the day.It tracks my sleep hours and it gives me good feedback, and you can set goals and they give you encouraging messages. I have had it less than a week but so far so good! It has exceeded my expectations in looks and functionality!",Love it so far!,5
2017-02-09,"I love my leaf urban. It is beautiful and versatile. I think it has a lot of great features that apply to me and I love the meditations. I have never really meditated before and it is wonderful. Especially the Deep Sleep one. Would absolutely recommend the Leaf for a beautiful, accurate activity tracker.",Leaf Urban,5
2017-03-06,"I have been interested in the Leaf for over a year now. I always resisted buying it because it seemed like a lot of money for something I know I don't ""Need"". However, it was definitely worth the money. I love it. Having my steps/activity logged for me to see is very gratifying and also motivating. I love my fit leaf!",Definitely worth it!,5
2017-04-11,"I LOVE my Bellabeat! This is the perfect solution for an activity tracker when you need to look professional. The versatility with the bracelet, necklace and clip has allowed me to wear this with any outfit. The way they have the bracelet clip on is such that I think I can create other cuffs or bracelets. I also am very pleased with the watch battery, I was never good at keeping my other activity trackers charged.",Perfect for professionals - versatile!,5
2017-04-11,"I love this tracker. I actually had the Nature but somehow lost it when traveling. I receive compliments almost daily when wearing it and always love the look on people's faces when I explain that it's not just a pretty piece of jewelry. As an added bonus, my 7 year old loves the guided meditation for when she's upset and can't calm herself.  Highly recommended.",I love this tracker,5
2017-02-06,"The inactive alert was a little hard to find, but otherwise it is exactly what I need. I could not find anything else that fit at my requirements: multiple ways to wear (including off of my wrist, which as a knitter can be very active), period tracker (couldn't find this anywhere else), and cute.",Exactly what I need,5
2017-03-31,"So first off, this works like a Fitbit. Which is awesome. But it also looks at sleep patterns, meditation, and menstrual cycles and uses all that to predict how susceptible you are to stress. So lots of added functionality. Plus, it's discreet and stylish. I've gotten compliments when wearing it as a necklace, and the bracelet is pretty useful when exercising. This has helped me stick to exercising and meditating every day, even if it's just a little bit, and I've gone from almost 70% susceptible to stress down to only 20%! I'm very happy with this product.",Love it!,5
2017-10-30,"Love my Bellabeat....it tracks my steps, cycle, meditation, sleep and water intake...you can add additonal activies for your workouts or steps.  I have already had to change the battery once but it lasted me almost 5 months.  Love that i dont have to charge it.",Love my Bellabeat,5
2017-03-28,"I love my new Leaf Tracker.  I wear mine as a necklace and it has been doing a great job tracking for me.  I have been impressed with how accurately it tracks my sleep.  I would have liked the option of using it for a bracelet but I was not able to wear it without it falling off the strap that came with the leaf, so I will probably look for an alternative.",I love my new Leaf Tracker,5
2017-04-11,"So far I really like my bellabeat!! It seems to track my steps fairly accurately.  I like it because you can add your own activities unlike the misfit that I just lost!  I have had no trouble with the hooks to keep the bellabeat on my wrist like others have said. I do check to see that it is hooked securely often.  I think the trick is to have it tight enough so it isn't able to fall off.My favorite part of the bella beat is that it has not only the step tracker, but activity tracker, menstrual cycle tracker, and sleep tracker.",So far I really like my bellabeat,5
2017-04-06,This tracking device for my whole body is amazing.  I find myself getting more exercise then I anticipated possible.  I use the meditation and enjoy knowing I am taking care of my body.  I tell those I care about how impressed I am - so much so they say I should be a paid spokesman.  I hope for additional software options to make it more custom to my individual needs.,Love it!  Would buy again - recommending it for my daughter.,5
2017-03-02,"This is my first fitness tracker and I love it. I got the rose gold and love to wear it as a bracelet, its so pretty! I love the option though on days when I don't feel like wearing jewelry I just clip it on my bra or tank which has ended up being very convenient and hassle free! (just have to remember to switch in the app that its registered as being clipped on my shirt during activity as opposed on my wrist) This has tracked pretty accurately so far and encourages me to work out since I have it set to vibrate every 3 hours if I'm being inactive. I'm trying to challenge myself to not let it need to vibrate. The sleep tracking is beyond accurate for me so far its almost scary. I make sure to look at the clock when I'm in bed and sure enough the app will show I fell asleep usually within 15 minutes of that time and knows when I wake up. I love the leaf and have already started suggesting it to my friends and family. I would have to say the only negative I have for the leaf is I wish I could write in my own activities for when I work out. I follow the 21 Day Fix workout videos and its been hard trying to group those into the activities included. I usually just add it in as aerobics or weightlifting but I really wish I could write in my own activity. But that is such a minor thing. Trust me, the leaf is worth it! It even syncs up to my health app on my iPhone and in that app I can see the leaf break down my step count per minute... Which is kinda cool.",Love it! Highly Recommend!,5
2017-06-08,"I had been wanting a Health Tracker for awhile, but the ones I kept being recommended were sporty. I'm not a sporty person. I enjoy jewelry. When I came across the Bellabeat Leaf, I loved the look and the different options for wearing it. After looking at reviews and how it tracks not only fitness, but also my monthly cycle and will track my pregnancy (once I reach that stage of life...) I was hooked. I've been using it 24/7 for a week now and can already say I'm in love.Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a fitness tracker, but also something fashionable.",but the ones I kept being recommended were sporty,5

I have not tried it as a necklace yet, but I will very soon .",L-O-V-E this LEAF!!,5
2017-04-01,I'm a fan of my Leaf. It's cuter than my last few activity trackers and the fact that I don't have to charge it each night is awesome. I've had it about a month now and love that is tells me my potential for stress. I get stressed pretty easily and just getting to see how my sleep and exercise effect my stress level help remind me to stay active and understand my moods. Don't really use the menstral tracker because I skip a lot of them. But I do like all the free downloadable meditation sessions. Very cool. I recommend this to everyone and brag about it all day at work!,Love my Leaf.,5

2017-11-03,"This was purchased for my wife. Her review follows: So far so good! I've had the leaf for a week now and am mostly using it as encouragement to move more. Having never had a step tracker before, I can't speak to it's accuracy but I find the statistics motivating and it's definitely much more attractive than any other fitness tracker I've seen. [This is largely why I hadn't had one before.] I am cautiously hopeful that it will continue to be motivating.",So far so good!,5
2017-05-17,"I purchased this approximately 2 weeks ago and I love it. I wasn't much of a fan of fitness trackers, but because this one shows stress vulnerability based on other factors entered, it has changed the way I look at it and myself. I would definitely recommend it and it looks cute too!",Love it,5
2018-03-04,"I love this product. It's more versatile than a lot of fitness trackers and works just as well. The phone app is a little less amazing, since I don't want to track my sleep it keeps asking me to input my sleep times. I can live with that minor annoyance, though.",I love this product,5

2017-02-11,Got this as a present for my wife and she loves it! She wanted a fitness tracker that was stylish and functional. This was the perfect fit. She was eyeing this out for a good month and was so happy when she got it in the mail. She didn't want to wait an entire month for it to come so Amazon Prime was the best way to go. Definitely recommend it!,Great accessory,5

2017-03-05,"I've had this a little over a week. It performs as advertised. I love having the option between the clip, necklace, and bracelet. The app was easy to figure out and I do enjoy the guided meditations included. My only issues so far are accidentally overwriting the sleep tracking and it falling off the necklace. I've accidentally overwritten the sleep assessment and had to manually input it (which doesn't include the light/heavy sleep analysis). Also, it tends to fall off occasionally when wearing the necklace.","So far, so good. What I expected.",5

I put on my head phones, and I'm learning the benefits of mediation. The only thing I like is the double wrap bracelet didn't fit my wrist. So I made me a few bracelets with stretching ribbons. I definitely word buy another Bellabeat. It's  not just a tracker, but a beautiful piece of jewelry.",Loving my Bellabeat Irban,5
2017-03-29,"Not only is this elegant by any standards, but can be worn as a necklace, a brooch (clip on) or the gorgeous wrist accessory.  It comes in rose gold, gold, and silver, with accessories for each that allow for diversity in your other clothes and jewelry.  The meditation app is special, and while I admit that I don't get to use it enough, I know it's there, and I do it when I can.  As a beginner to mid-skills meditation person, the guided meditations are a big plus.  You choose the subject, the time, and you can fit it in in almost any time period.  The app for my phone is perfect.  Only one thing - I can't wait until you hook up to Weight Watchers so I can sync with that automatically.  Also - y eldest is getting married this year - can you tell what I am waiting for?  While it no longer matters to me, the menstrual cycle/fertility tracker will be a good thing.  They also sell the ""shell"" a baby's heart beat monitor.  More to look forward to!","The most beautiful, versatile tracker, with the most unique features out there.",5

The meditation options are great, and the reminders to get up and move during the day are helpful to keep active. I look forward to it learning my habits and becoming better at tracking my sleep and my stress the more I wear it. I also really like the lighter color option of the gray/silver vs. the black/rose gold, but I love that there are interchangeable options for bracelet bands, and you can even get another clip to mix and match it. Overall a good buy.",Love it!,5
2017-04-11,"I replaced my Fitbit Charge HR with this tracker. My Charge HR had fallen apart twice in the last 6 months and I was looking to try another brand. It was a transition since this tracker does not have a screen but the versatility and aesthetics are worth the transition. It can be a bit tricky at first to get the wrist strap situated but it's definitely my favorite way of wearing it. I also occasionally clip it to my shirt for work outs.I love the app. Not having the interface on the tracker allows for so much more functionality. The meditation exercises are fantastic as well and it's really helped me to manage my stress. The sleep tracking is pretty spot on after a couple sleeps where it was ""learning"".

2017-04-11,I'm a former Fitbit user and wasn't sure I'd like this as much. I LOVE IT. The app is easy to use and it looks great stacked with other bracelets. I'm never going back to any other fitness tracker.,Love it!,5
2017-04-16,"This is a really nice alternative to other ugly, bulkier, fitness trackers. As someone who is terrible at recognizing on my own when I'm overdoing it, I'm loving the stress resistance visualizations, and I've been impressed with the accuracy of the sleep tracking. It is also a nice bonus to be able to set an alarm that won't wake up my partner!",Great Tracker - That's Also Attractive,5
2018-06-15,I have had my tracker for several weeks.  I like the fact that I can wear it around my neck from a chain.  I can't wear braclets or a watch and this tracker fixes the problem.  Now I can keep up to date with my physical activity.,Easy to wear.,5
2017-05-15,"I love this tracker--It's not only accurate with measuring my sleep/awake periods at night, but it also has helped me with meditating on a more consistent basis.

I love it, and highly recommend this product!",This nurse HIGHLY recommends this product!,5
2017-03-30,"So far, I love my Leaf! I wanted to see how long the battery would last and if I'd actually use it. I've had lots and lots of people complement me on it, thinking it's just a piece of jewelry. I think my favorite part is the guided meditations, especially the 2 minute sessions that I can do at work on break. I'd buy it again. For sure!",Love it!!,5

2017-03-28,I absolutely LOVE my leaf. My favorite feature is the on-demand Bluetooth technology so I know I'm not emitting signals throughout the day and while I sleep. My second favorite feature is the alarms. For my work I need something to alert me to the time without it being a distraction to others. The meditation scripts are great too. I highly recommend this activity tracker!,Love love love it!,5

2017-03-31,"I love my leaf! I've never had a fitness tracker before, but wanted one to track my walk and sleep patterns. I work in a corporate environment in LA so attire/accessories matter.  I often pair it with a chic mala bracelet or a cuff, and have gotten so many compliments on how gorgeous it is.When it first arrived, I was super bummed that the battery appeared to be empty, so I quickly ordered 4 on Amazon (for $8). However, after Day 2, the battery went to full, so I think it was just a glitch in registering it when booted up.Functionality-wise, it does an awesome job in tracking my steps, distance, activities, and I love that it tracks the quality of my sleep. Nights I dream a lot, it definitely registers the ""light"" parts of my sleep, and when I'm dead to the world, I've hit 91% deep sleep.I do hope to start a family eventually, so the fertility tracker is super unique.Overall, 5 stars for this item; would highly recommend; and would definitely buy as a gift!",Love my Leaf!,5

I hope they release more straps eventually because I would like to buy some more options to change things up.  Also I would like the company to offer the option of different bracelet strap sizes when you purchase the Leaf.,Beautiful design and great service,5
2017-03-16,"I have had my Leaf Urban for about a week now and, of course, the fact that something is ""tracking"" me makes me motivated to move more! However, the fact that the Leaf is beautiful means that I am motivated and HAPPY to wear it - win-win! I like that it's water-resistant, I stress less about washing my hands. I love the bracelet wrap. I have received compliments on it daily - and they only increase when I tell people what the Leaf does!

The app is easy to use, you do have to sync it manually, but that prevents me from obsessively checking my stats. I really enjoy the meditation component, and the alarm tool is strong enough to wake me up (but is not obnoxious).

I haven't necessarily wanted to wear a tracker but after seeing how nice this bellabeat was and that it didn't look like your typically tracker I wanted to try it.

It's very motivating to see your steps and I LOVE the fact that I can put in my water intake - since I'm not a big water drinker I am really benefitting from the motivation to put those 8 oz of water in every time and reach my goal of 80 oz. The meditations are also very helpful and I like the fact that they are simple.,It builds a better me!,5
2017-04-20,"For a long time I've wanted a fitness tracker that doesn't look clunky and digital. So naturally I was excited to find out about the Leaf. In real life it looks just as good or better than in photos. I've had a lot of conversations already with people who commented on it thinking that it was jewelry, and were surprised to learn that it was (also) a fitness tracker. I will say that it is a bit thicker than I imagined so the necklace or bracelet options could look a little clunky, depending on your style. But you can always use it as a clip also and hide the body which makes it look even more appealing.Of course good looks alone are not enough - it also has to work well as a tracker. And fortunately it does! The app is intuitive and easy to use. I quickly got into the habit of checking in on the app from time to time when I wanted to check how I was doing; and the rest of the time I don't worry about it. (Which is just how it should be.) Step counting seems to be more accurate and sensitive than phone app trackers. Sleep tracking works quite well. The meditation options are really nice - not just tracking but also different kinds of meditation to try. (I haven't used the reproductive tracker).There are certainly a few things that could be improved in the app. All syncing is done manually and it seems like some of this could be automated. Activity other than walking also needs to be added manually - in some cases that makes sense (for an obscure or hard to track activity), but couldn't something like cycling be detected automatically? The stress counter seems pretty arbitrary. (It would be great if there were some physical tracking for heartbeat or other things that might actually correlate to stress, but that would be a different design for the product.)But frankly none of those issues are enough to knock the Leaf down. Hopefully future versions will make improvements to some of these issues and make it work even a little more smoothly. But even as it is it's a great product and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends who are looking for a stylish and fun fitness tracker.",In real life it looks just as good or better than in photos,5
2018-03-21,I love it so far! It's so cute and easy to wear. I enjoy the alarm and meditation feature. I can't wait until I've had my period so I can begin tracking that and fertility!!! 🤗,LOVING THIS!!!,5

2017-04-04,"I LOVE my Bellabeat leaf! Not only is it so pretty and fashionable, but it actually motivates me to move! I subconsciously walk more throughout the day so that when I check my step counts it can be higher than the day before. I am also able to track my weight, stress, period, really everything! It's truly helpful. Also, I just want to add that I was out of US for a week and everyone was obsessed with my leaf, saying it was a beautiful piece of jewelry, & when I mentioned it was a tool, they were so fascinated haha!

The alarms, meditations, and motivational tidbits really add to the product. I have small wrists and its not quite as bulky as i was expecting.For the most part it seems fairly accurate, but I have not used a fitness tracker before. I think the most improvement is needed on the sleep tracking. Sometimes it doesn't catch when I get up to use the bathroom during the night or when I wake up but am still lying down. I wish I could correct the sleep times and still keep the light/deep sleep data. It would also be great you have a heartbeat monitor as well. I would also love to be able to adjust the fertility tracking to change the cycle from 28 days. Not everyone has a textbook 28 day cycle. That being said, I love the product and would recommend it!",Cute and versatile!,5
2017-02-17,"I really enjoy using this. I have a job where I can't have my phone with me, so having a device that can store days and days worth of data before syncing has been very, very useful.

2017-03-03,"This is a really great fitness tracker for women!  I like how it takes into account activity,sleep,meditation, and where you are in your cycle to let you know how prone you are to stress.  The focus is on the health of your body and mind, which is really nice, especially if you struggle with mental health issues.  In addition to logging your steps, you can add other activities in the app and the range is amazing! The list includes more typical exercise activities like yoga,swimming or  Zumba, but also activities that women,especially moms, might do in their everyday lives like breastfeeding, playing with kids, shopping, and even sex.  I feel like the app really acknowledges the fact that women can be really busy and might not have time to go to the gym, but are active in other ways.  The guided meditations are really calming.  There are many to choose from and they are titled so you can pick one out based on how you want to adjust your mental state. The period tracking function is pretty simple, but it works well. It will predict future cycles, but you tell it when your period actually stops and starts.  You can also add a pregnancy under cycling tracking and then track your pregnancy.  Additionally, it is really great that the can be worn as a bracelet, necklace or clip because it give you so many options when you're planning your outfits.  I find that this way I am not tempted to skip a day because it works with most outfits, and if need be you can just clip it.  I love my leaf,and I feel like it was designed with my health needs in mind.",Perfect for Women,5
2021-10-13,"I bought the Leaf in 6/21 at the same time I joined Noom. I was excited to track my steps, activity, sleep, and mindfulness as I have become very committed to losing weight. For the first three months it worked great, or so I thought. Then about three weeks ago the pairing became inconsistent. We tried changing out the battery that it came with, twice, despite the device still reading as having a full battery. Then within the past week it stopped syncing all together. I followed all the advice from Bellabeat on ways to repair the Leaf and no I never wore it in the shower, when washing my hands, or when doing dishes. I also clipped it on my bra during workouts and immediately wiped it off with a soft cloth after working out. In short, I was VERY careful with it (I am a student and have a desk job, so it was never banged around). If you are interested in this, proceed with caution. Here is what I experienced:PROS:Stylish and comfortable when clipped on my bra or shirtLOVED the mindfulness option and the meditations they offered through the company for freeDid well keeping track of my water intake when I entered the dataCONS:Step tracker was WAY off from my iPhone step tracker that links to Noom, I was constantly getting two very different readingsSleep tracker was inconsistent, would show me as being awake for 1-2 hours each night and other times when I was sound asleepDespite having new batteries and following all reinstalling/re-pairing instructions it slowly became very inconsistent with pairing and then after 3 1/2 months just stopped working :(Bracelet was cumbersome and uncomfortable most of the timeAs noted, I wanted to love this device and have it see me through my weight loss journey, but just like my weight, this device is coming off so I can find something that actually works.

I haven't worn the necklace quite yet. I have only good things to say!",Love it,5

2017-02-09,"Thank you for providing a Fitness Tracking option that fits my life and my fashion sense.  I know those two elements don't seem like they should mesh, but if I don't wear my tracker because I don't like how it looks, then I'm not getting the information that lets me modify my activity levels for my fitness goals.  How I look in my professional life is important - and the other options ""blow"" the professional image I'm trying to project.  I get lots of remarks on the tracker itself - about how nice it looks.  I'll then share it's my tracker, and they get very excited!Another element that I find great is the integration of the data collected for an overall stress assessment.  I juggle this daily and the graphic reminder of how different elements combine for my overall health makes me more aware of the balance needed.  Alarms to remind me to move, to take meds, to wake - all help me remember that I need to care for myself.I am enjoying the app and the added features it provides...Thank you again for a great product!",I know those two elements don't seem like they should mesh,5

2017-02-10,"I love my new Leaf Urban tracker.  As someone who has used other trackers I was sold on the fact that this is for women, so it looks feminine and it can be worn multiple ways.

I have not regretted my decision and I look forward to enjoying my Leaf for a long time to come!","A feminine and beautiful, yet practical tracker!",5
2016-12-15,"My friend loves her Urban and she can't stop talking about it. Since she's got it, she's constantly tracking her activity and seems very motivated.

I think this would be a great Christmas present for moms as well.",Beautiful product,5
2017-07-04,I love the Bellabeat Leaf. The only thing that is a negative is if I'm riding on the motorcycle it does count steps. But not everything is perfect other than that I love it. I did let them know and they said they are working on this.,I love the Bellabeat Leaf,5

2017-02-09,"So far I've loved using my Leaf. It's not just another fitbit type activity tracker, it's cute. Plus, I really dislike wearing bracelets, they get in the way while I'm working. With the Leaf, being able to clip in on or wear it as a necklace is a fantastic option.",Yes.,5

2017-01-20,"I love my Leaf Urban.  It is just as accurate as my Fit Bit but much nicer to look at.  It was spot on with the sleep tracking.  I input the last few of my menstruation in the tracker and it calculated my cycle and was correct to the day.  Family Planning and fitness tracking in one easy app.  The only ""fault"" I have seen is the alarms, the wake up alarm is very gentle and I never feel it on my wrist.",Love it,5
2017-03-30,"I absolutely love this tracker!  I've gotten so many compliments on my lovely necklace - no one can tell that it's actually a fitness tracker.

2017-12-01,I love my Bellabeat Leaf! I wear it all day/night and forget its even there. My favorite part is the meditations. I have a really hard time falling asleep. I have been putting the 9 minute sleep meditation on and have never listened until the end because I've already fallen asleep!,Love it!,5
2017-02-28,"This is a great tracker if you are looking for something simple, chic, and easy to use! I love the versatility of the wrist band, necklace, and clothes clip options. This works great if you are looking for a pedometer, sleep tracker, and period tracker. This item does not physically track your activities, you have to manually input them, but when you use the Bellabeat app it is a great way to have all your fitness plans, goals, and activities all in one place. Also, all you have to do it press the sync button on the app and it uploads all your information that your Bellabeat collected, and it only takes a few seconds! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something simple but really want it to look awesome too. :)",Easy to use!,5

2017-03-31,"I purchased the Bellabeat urban leaf for my wife, and she loves it.  Here is what she has to say about it:The leaf is the best health tracker I have ever tried!  Not only does it track steps, exercise, and sleep, but it also tracks your monthly cycle and your meditation and stress levels.  I was looking for a health tracker that helped me lower my stress levels and learn how to meditate.  This is the only accessory I have ever tried that does this well!  It is also extremely comfortable to wear and functional since I can wear it in numerous different ways.  People compliment me on it all the time, and they are always intrigued that there are free guided meditations as part of the app.  I also love that I can track my breath with the waves within the meditations.  It is very easy to get used to and comfortable to clip on to my shorts at night.  And it even provides positive encouragement and feedback based on your progress.  I love it!The only downside is that there is no heart rate monitor specifically. I understand why, but I also like to be able to see my heart rate instantly when working out or trying to calm down during a stressful situation.  That is the only thing I would change.","Fantastic, unique product!",5
2017-05-11,"Love that it tracks stress levels, sleep patterns, but wished it tracked heart rate.",Glad I bought it,5
2017-02-13,"I bought the leaf urban silver this past summer when I was looking for a activity tracker. Several of my friends have Fitbits that they wear all the time, but I noticed when we'd dress up and go out for girls night they never wore them because they looked clunky, and it seemed silly to me to miss these key hours of activity, so I started looking for an alternative and came across Bellabeat. And I have not regretted my decision. As my husband can attest to I hardly ever take it off and I've gotten so many compliments on my ""bracelet"" hehe. People are always shocked when I tell them its actually a health tracker. So good job Bellabeat for disguising it so well! :)I'm still giving this five stars just because I love it so much but I do have one tiny complaint. I'm an outdoor girl and while I try to be careful I tend to be pretty hard on my stuff. After wearing it regularly for the last six months or so the one thing I've noticed is that the stainless steel scratches fairly easily, although unless you're looking for them you can't really tell. I would love it if they could figure out how to make it more durable. Regardless, to any lady out there who loves jewelry but still wants a functional way to track their sleep and activity I would totally recommend this product.",Love my Leaf!,5

2017-02-09,So far I am loving the Leaf! I have only had it for about a week now and I am just getting used to it. Definitely recommend it for others! Much nicer and more feminine than the fitbit. Very easy to use and sync with the phone. The only issue which isn't a big deal is the clasps do not fully close on the actual leaf. I am making another bracelet band for it and that should work just fine!,Definitely recommend it for others,5

2017-01-24,"I am one of those people that always thought I didn't need a fitness gadget because my phone would be good enough to estimate my activity, right? Well I got tired of my phone reporting that I went out for a long jog when all I did was sit on a slow bus.I was torn between getting a Fitbit and the Leaf Urban. The Leaf Urban won out because of its versatility: I am not stuck with just wearing something on my wrist all the time. I can clip it to a fitted shirt or sports bra, wear it as a bracelet or a necklace if I want to dress up. I also wanted something that I didn't have to charge every couple of days.Now that I've used it for a while, I'm glad I went with the Leaf Urban. I wear it all the time, one way or another. It tracks my steps throughout the day, and it's pretty simple to sync with the app (to save battery, it does not sync until you manually tap it twice - super easy). I can also add any exercises - today I did ballet barre exercises and there was an option for that in the app. It calculated calories burned based on my weight and time spent exercising.I'm also really happy with the sleep tracking. I can see how often I was in deep sleep and for how long (you don't move when you're in deep sleep). If I get up to pee, the tracker makes note of the minutes I was awake (see attached photo). I just started trying out the alarm setting so that it vibrates in the morning to wake me up and it's really gentle, but effective. Perfect if you're a light sleeper and don't like the jarring sound of alarm clocks.All in all, I'm impressed.",Impressive fitness and lifestyle gadget,5

2017-03-28,"I absolutely love my Leaf. I was skeptical at first, but bought it after a particularly stressful few weeks mostly because a tracker that also helps me manage stress is the full package, is far as I was concerned. I found that it and my Google Health app were almost exactly in line with each other (my work phone, which doesn't sync the Leaf). There's no doubt of it's accuracy, and I have put it through the ringer as far as wearing it in different locations to try to find a fault.It's also really pretty. It's a lovely piece of jewelry as well, and I adore it's look. I do think there's a fatal flaw in the design of the bracelet which I cannot seem to keep on my wrist, but it doesn't deter from wanting to use it. I did buy a different bracelet with trickier to get on by yourself latches, but then it stays put.I'd definitely recommend this tracker to anyone, but especially to those who suffer from high anxiety or stress because the guided mediation is excellent.","LOVE the tracker, mediation. Bracelet could use a better design",5
2017-04-12,I would recommend this to everyone. Great piece!,Five Stars,5
2017-04-02,I love that I can wear it discreetly. I didn't want to wear a clunky tracking bracelet so it's great that I can clip it to my bra. The app is great too. It's nice that I can track other things like stress and fertility.,Love my new tracker!,5
2016-11-29,"Update - I've been wearing the Leaf for a while now and still love it. I've also turned a lot of friends on to it as the most fashion-forward fitness and health tracker around.I wore a Surge for over a year, and while I was happy with the food and activity logs, it was awkward to sleep with and honestly looked unprofessional for my work life.  Big, clunky and on top of that, it never kept the time zones properly when I traveled.  I randomly saw the Leaf when looking for a more acceptable choice and am thrilled.  I love the flexibility of the wear methods and the sleek look - I get lots of comments and people are so impressed that it's not just a piece of jewelry. Next I'd love to see optional colors for the wrist strap...I'd love to add a black color strap to switch out from the tan one I have; or options for other colors. Great product.",Finally a fashion forward activity tracker!,5
2016-11-23,I love my Urban Leaf! No one can even tell that it's a fitness tracker - it is a beautiful jewelry piece and not bulky like other fitness trackers. The app is amazing offers more than other fitness apps and I love the free meditations on the app. I wear mine every day - great motivational tool! I get compliments on it all the time!,Best fitness tracker!,5
2016-11-17,"Love my Urban Leaf and its versatility on how I can wear it.  It tracks what I need it to track. I can check to make sure I've reached my step goal for the day and I like the little info tips it provides. My favorite feature is the meditation goal and it's instant access to meditation audio, definitely helps when I am having a stressful day.",Stress free,5
2017-02-28,"I bought a Bellabeat Leaf Urban a couple weeks ago and am still learning it, but absolutely love it.  It fits well on my wrist and tracks my health in a way a Fitbit cannot do for women.  I used to have multiple apps to track my health (including fertility), but now I only have to have one app!  I think my favorite part is the meditation piece.  You can choose from multiple types of meditation sound bites depending upon your current situation and they really work!  The fact this is an overall health tracker has really kept me motivated to stay calm and relax instead of solely focusing on my daily steps.  Thank you for creating this and making it so stylish!",Love my Leaf Urban!,5
2017-02-09,"I'm so in love with my Leaf Urban! I wear it non-stop except in the shower, but I'm pretty sure I could do that too. I was never really one to meditate, but with the built in app, I find myself making time for ME even if it is just 2, 3 or 10 minutes each day.","Never thought I would meditate, but my Leaf Urban makes it easy!",5

2017-04-28,"Thought about purchasing this product for a month or so. Wasn't sure if it was worth it. Decided to give it a go and love it. I went with the leaf urban, silver.  Love it as a bracelet. Wore it as a necklace once.  App is good and seems like an accurate tracker.",Happy with purchase,5
2017-02-17,I use my leaf faithfully and absolutely LOVE IT. I have had android and apples smart watches also several fit bits. But they all seemed to be in the way. I couldn't switch up watches to coordinate with my outfits. The fit bit bands didn't coordinate well and yes I've had the clip on versions that end in the washing machines. Trust me i'm in no way knocking the other brands. But the Leaf has been may happy medium. Even causing me to conveniently  meditate more! I wear it as a necklace mainly as it's more convenient for me. I've been toying with the idea of purchasing another for convenient wrist wear. Again it's exactly what I've been looking for in a fitness tracker.,Exactly what I've been looking for!,5

2019-07-11,"This is a review of their customer service only. If you like ridiculous processes, this is the place for you. While I really like my device, it all of a sudden stopped working. I reached out to the company for support.First, you can't call...they conveniently do not have a call center. So i used the support feature in the app to chat. When I outlined the problem, I was told to send an email to their support people. If the chat feature is for customer support, why would I need to do that??? Not wanting to be difficult, I sent the email and didn't hear back from them. When I reached out again, I specifically mentioned to the agent that I hadn't heard back from customer support and she began to help me (which for me was confirmation that the email thing is an absolute waste of time). Anyhow, as she walked me through the steps I'd need to take to try to fix the problem, the headache became too much to bear: I'd have to take the device apart again, take pictures of the inside of the device, replace the battery again, unpair the device, shut down my wifi, log out of the app, log in, pair the device again all while taking pictures of all I did, and then upload the pictures to them and start the whole ridiculous chat process again with someone who may or may not know what the heck is going on. The agent did say the chat is uploaded to my customer profile, but I'd had enough and requested they send me a replacement device.The headache of this is unnecessary and if I had the option, I'd just get my money back. We will see what this replacement process looks like but I'm losing faith in customer service here and what it could be.",Prepare for subpar customer service.,3

2017-05-22,"I had been wanting the Bellabeat for a long time, BUT I didn't want to spend the money (they're not cheap, as you know). I've tried other step trackers, but they generally look so clunky and ugly.... It's hard to want to wear a step tracker when you're going out. Well, this step tracker does not have that problem. The Urban Leaf is super cute. The necklace looks fancy....so much so that I've had no less than 5 compliments on it from people that had no idea it was a step tracker...they just thought it was a nice piece of jewelry. So Bellabeat gets huge points for that.Unfortunately, there is a downside (of course). Number one, the leaf will sometimes fall off the necklace when I am doing more vigorous activity (jumping mostly). That has happened 2-3 times which makes me nervous that I'll lose the step tracker. Number 2, the leaf does not track sleep accurately. I can toss and turn all night and it'll say I slept calmly. It does a good job measuring when you lay down and when you get up in the morning, but it hasn't once shown a time when I got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night (which happens) and I haven't figured a way to input disruptions in sleep into the app ( it'll only let me adjust the falling asleep and waking up time). Even my inexpensive jawbone up recorded sleep more accurately. Number 3, the leaf does not track increase in elevation, so even if you climb  a ton of stairs, you don't get extra credit for them being stairs and therefore the calorie burned count is highly inaccurate. Number 4, my biggest complaint, the leaf is supposed to be an activity tracker SO I clip it on my sports bra when I do yoga. It doesn't usually record much during yoga despite it being a vigorous work out because it doesn't involve stepping per se, but it does record some steps. Here's the issue: when I input yoga into the app as an activity, the app deletes any steps taken during the time I was doing yoga making wearing the leaf during activity completely pointless. Additionally, the app doesn't count your activity toward your step goal. Now, you can change your goal to be minutes active, but then you lose the step count.  For these reasons, I feel the Bellabeat is a nice looking but overpriced and subpar fitness tracking device.",Nice looking but less functional than I hoped,3

The Bellabeat Leaf Urban solved this problem!  The versatility in wearing it as a necklace, bracelet or pretty clip is fantastic.  I am only 2 weeks into using it and it's already given me great information (daily steps, ability to add workout information, tracking sleep cycles and meditation).

2017-01-12,"I mostly bought the Leaf because I wanted the sleep tracker and stress tracker. I have anxiety, so I like being aware of my sleep patterns and how it causes an effect on my mental health.Most people's cons: I don't have anything to compare the step accuracy, which a lot of people had concerns over, so if it's actually wrong, I have no idea. I've never had the bracelet come undone (I think people aren't tightening it enough?), and I've never had it slip off as a clip.My pros: I loooove it. I think it's beautiful and I love that you can wear it different ways. I've read a lot of reviews, and the developers respond very quickly, and they actually make changes according to customer suggestions! Their involvement sold me on the Leaf. At first, I didn't think I'd ever use the meditation options, but I surprisingly love it. I love the vibration alarms (it doesn't wake me up at night, but it's helpful to remember to take my medicine when I'm awake!). Lastly, I love the little messages; they're sweet, have happy smiley faces, and they make me feel great when I see them. After a good night of sleep, I get to wake up a see, ""If you and Sleeping Beauty were competing, you'd probably win!"" or ""Well rested and fly. Yup, that's you! :)"" After a bad night of sleep, it tells me, ""We don't want to sound like your mom, but GO TO BED (please, it will do you good),"" or ""They say that if you can't sleep well at night, you are either in love or sad. We hope you're in love!"" I AM in love! After a poor night of sleep, it's nice to wake up and instantly think of being in love.I love it. The developers seem like great people.","This is my first fitness tracker, and I love it!",5

Although I don't use it to track my period or for the mediation sessions, it's really nice to know that I have those two options. After a few weeks of having it, it fell off of me and when I reported it to the company, they were very accommodating and helpful.

2017-06-06,"The Bellabeat Leaf Health Tracker and accompanying app are perfect for my needs. I wanted a fitness tracker that would be on me at all times while at work, including when I need to look professional and leave my phone behind for meetings, as well as at home wearing PJs with no pockets and chasing my 4 year old around the house. The variety of options for wearability make it easy to accommodate my changing needs throughout the day. For an hour every day, I work at a walking station in the office, and my wrist is wresting on the desk as I type. Were I wearing a tracker that only is worn on the wrist, I would lose those steps, and I abhor the look of standard clip-on trackers.The app is elegant and easy to use, and as a graphic designer, I cringe to use apps that are not both effective and visually pleasing. The app offers several meditations, and the leaf tracks your breathing.The leaf does lack heart rate monitor, but at my age and fitness level, it's not a priority for me, and I have read many reviews that, if you really want an accurate heart rate monitor, you need to use a chest strap.","Simple, Perfect for Me",5

The only complaint I have so far (as others have mentioned) is that the bracelet can sometimes fall off if you're moving around a bunch (not necessarily walking, but cleaning/moving things around). Hasn't been a big issue yet as anytime I'm moving around a bunch I will just clip it onto my shirt/pants pocket.","I've only had it for about a week now, ...",5
2020-11-12,"First off- If you have any interest in the Bellabeat product line, hold off until you get a membership to the app subscription.  It includes 30% discount codes on their products, which of course you won't know until after you buy the products and get the app to attempt to maximize functionality.Now for the reality: I like the idea of this tracker.  My facility policy requires us to not carry cell phones, and they discourage wearing items on our wrists. This seemed like a great idea!  I can use it to remind me to move, help keep me stay more alert on the night shift, encourage me to eat healthier, drink more water, and take some time to center myself., plus remind me to take my meds, get to bed on time, etc.The reality so far is this:  neither the bottle nor the leaf seems to track reliably, and if they do, they don't update for several syncs sometimes.  The mindfulness function doesn't want to track at all. The sleep tracker only self operates between 9 pm and 9 am., if you are a night shift worker you will not have access to any of that functionality and have to manually add in the information.  Very few of the alerts seem to be anywhere near operational.  I only get alerts to take my medicine and wake up. I don't get movement notifications or hydration notifications at all.  I even tried to sign up for their Bellabeat+ subscription to see if that was the issue, only to find that won't sync up with the app at all either. I can see it for the split second it takes to ""load"" then it's completely inaccessible.I seriously think the issues may be related to the companion app because I'm having similar issues with the Spring bottle. Unfortunately, since the only data readouts are on the app, a bad app definitely affects the rating on this product.Also, Bellabeat's customer service is really crappy.  I can't get the membership to work correctly, Bellabeat's only available by email when they think it's convenient for them, which is only about 3 and 10 am EST.  So far they're really dismissive of issues with their products, and I've been trying to get issues resolved for three days.","Not night shift friendly, bad manufacturer customer service, etc.",2
2021-03-10,"Love the Bella beat as a tracker. It Hass been great for all the things it is supposed to do. However, the low rating is because I just hit the point where I have to change the battery for the first time, and bow it won't connect at all. I tried several different batteries in case the first new one I tried was bad, but still no luck. I don't know if it's my specific tracker or if this is a regular occurrence for people. Because I'm outside my ""support period"" through Amazon, I have to go through the company, and so far, I'm unable to get a response from them. So I think I'll get a device that is recharge able and actually has some way to know where it is even on or not.",Device worked great until I needed to change the battery.,2

2017-02-10,I've been wearing my Leaf for a few weeks. Here are my pros: 1.  It's super cute 2. The meditations are really helpful and have been a great aid in getting to sleep and unwinding after a long day 3. The sleep data has been really interesting and I've found patterns that I can address to help me get better sleep 4. The step counter keeps me motivated to move 5. It works well on my wrist and as a necklace.  The cons: 1. The Leaf does not stay on my waistband well. It slides off easily and has dropped to the floor when I sit down. I worry I'll lose it 2. I'd love a good tracking feature on the app.  Overall I love it and have found it a nic motivating factor in taking care of myself.,Really liking it!,5

Not only does it do everything I want it to, it looks great too. There was a concern I had before purchasing it, that it would look bulky, it was kind of hard for me to tell from the pictures, but it really isn't as bulky as some of them make it look.

2017-04-04,"I love my Bellabeat! I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing my review to get used to it and really learn all the ins and outs! I love that it is customizable as far as your goals go for steps, sleep, meditation and setting up your menstrual cycle month to month. The vibration wake up alarm is very pleasant and I have only slept through it once (i keep my phone alarm set as a back up still). One of the reasons I chose Bellabeat is for tracking my period as we would like to start trying to become pregnant in the next few months and this has helped me to get to know my body on a whole other level! My obgyn loves this also! My main reason for purchasing this product was the user friendly app and the need to never charge it! I am obsessed with the fact that I literally never have to take it off, not even for showering, (well for the 6 month lifespan of the battery). Not having to take it off means I never forget it at home or find it not charged up in the morning! Its also very simply to wear and looks great with every outfit! My only downfall has been that the one side of the pendant continuously gets caught on my clothing, purses, grocery bags ect. (See picture) My husband has had to take mine apart and rebend it twice already... i am afraid that over time it may break completly or it may eventually not have a water tight sleal anymore! Now I do have to say that I am very rough on jewlery and have not heard or read this happening to anyone else but I do think that this design could be reworked as well as the open clasps.I can not talk enough about how much I love my Bellabeat and would never buy another heath tracker again! I highly recommend it to everyone!!!",Best healthtracker! LOVEEE!,5
2020-08-18,"This product worked for a month. It has stopped tracking sleep and steps. Every single day for the past two weeks, I have had to fill out a form to report my problem. Then later in the day, it begins tracking. It is ridiculous that I would have to report a tracking problem each day for two weeks. I have asked to cancel my membership and I have heard nothing back. I absolutely hate this product.",I hate this product! AVOID!!!!!!,1
2017-05-05,"I was SO excited for this!  But I find myself disappointed. . .1. Although the description does not state that it tracks heartbeat, I think maybe I assumed that it did because its called BellaBEAT, and that this featured is offered pretty much on all other similar devices.  It does NOT track heartbeat.  My fault for not reading better.2. I was super psyched that it could track my period, but honestly, all it is - is a calendar that you input the information in and then it tells you when to expect your next period, ovulation and fertility based on that info.  I have an app on my phone that does this.  A free app.3.  The mediation guides are nice, but again, I have an app on my phone that has these.  A free app.4.  Each time you want to check stats, you have to open the app and tell it to sync with the leaf, which for me, doesn't always work the first time.Now I'll tell you what I like about it.1. It's so pretty!  And I love how you can wear it 3 different ways.  I like how it looks like a piece of jewelry and not a techy device.  Its much softer looking- and even a little intriguing.2. The gentle vibrating alarms.  I set 3 alarms- one to wake me up (although, it is so gentle that it did not wake me up), another alarm for morning meds, and another for nighttime meds.  I like this reminder feature.  But again....my phone could do this.3. It takes the all of the data (sleep, activity, meditation and period) and projects potential stress.I am still deciding if I am going to keep it or not, but I have my eye on another device that does a lot more, including tracking heartbeat.",I wanted to love this. . .,3
2021-05-10,"I have an average wrist at 6.5"" and the band barely fits. As you can see from the photos the band is the last possible hole. Between the last hole and the substantial gap on the attachment, the band breaks loose and the tracker falls off. The microscopic screws make it difficult to change out the battery and the clip. The app only tracks my activity about half the time. So far none of the alerts have worked as indicated.",Best fits PETITE,3
2018-03-09,"I want to love my Bellabeat Leaf. Im trying to love it, and yet it is falling slightly short. Its beautiful and looks like jewelry which is a plus for me....I like using a fitness/health tracker for the feedback they provide...and all of them are huge clunky monstrosities-except this! I kinda miss my cell phone alerts...and Im getting over it as well.  Fewer distractions seems like a good thing. What I REALLY do miss is the heart monitor. This is something I need to track and without it I am forced to check it manually--rats! The steps counted are not super accurate--close, but off every day (the treadmill or elliptical says I went 5 miles and my Leaf says 4.1 for example).  Im working with the sleep tracker.  I set my sleep time at 9pm, but I often hit the hay earlier which is not captured automatically.  I'm tracking my period as a peri-menopausal woman...I could care less about fertility, Just tracking it until the end! YAY! I'm still early in the Leaf-wearing process--only 12 days in.  If things improve or I adjust settings that work better for my lifestyle I'll update this, but 4 stars is pretty good. I would recommend this!","Like, not love......yet.",4

2017-09-19,"Love how pretty it is! You don't have to charge it, which is very convenient. Also, I love that I can clip it to my shirt to track my sleep. I can't stand sleeping in jewelry, but clipping it to my shirt doesn't bother me at all. I couldn't track my sleep with previous fitness trackers because I couldn't stand to sleep with it on my wrist. Finally, it's actually kept me motivated to stay active. Love it!",Very happy!,5
2020-01-23,I received it on Sept 18. It was easy to set up and the app is pretty nice. You have to always sync it with the app manually. It does not always sync when you attempt to sync it. You have to tap it twice to get it to sync. It is January and the battery needs replaced but nothing indicated it in the app or device. According to the app the battery was still completely charged. It just stopped tracking and syncing. I changed the battery and it synced but it did not retrieve the information for the last couple of days. Then it stopped working. I checked the battery again and it synced for that day with the sleep/step data. I emailed Bellabeat and they responded promptly and asked me to deinstall the app and battery and reinstall again. It worked once and did not work again. I told them and they said to move the pins under the battery. I did and it synced but it has not record any information for the last couple of days. Now it is not working again. It won’t sync or record any information. It is pretty but large to wear and not real accurate from the time I got it and after 4 months doesn’t work at all. Too expensive for reliability issues. Had a tracker I loved that is no longer made for half the price and it worked better for longer.Update: my replacement one needed a battery change and was working at first but eventually stopped tracking steps sometimes or sleep others. Some days it doesn’t track anything. Changed battery again and had same problems. Un-synced device because that was a last resort last time and it would never sync again. Researching a replacement. 2 in one year is a little excessive for the price when I’ve gotten cheaper ones that have lasted longer.,Pretty but not reliable,2

This is my preferred way to wear and mine has fallen off a couple times but I was at home luckily and was able to find it quickly.",LOVE THE LEAF!,5
2018-07-08,"I never thought I would be glad to receive a defective product, but I was. It appears I received someone else's return as the chain was missing, the clip was scratched and leaf itself was locked - turned out to be the best thing that could have happened.At this price and hype, I expected something...more. The tracker itself is cheap plastic polymer that is suppose to look like stone - maybe from a great distance. It is held in the clip by 4 safety screws that reveal, once removed, that the tracker has no back, just a rubber-ish membrane that sits between the guts / battery and the rear of the clip. I did not find this impressive as the unit is touted as water resistant- for this price I expected a sealed unit.The chain was missing but if it's anything like the ""bracelet"" than I don't feel I missed much. The ""genuine leather"" is flimsy and the C-clips meant to secure the tracker are too large - add the crimping in the band from the packaging and it took several tries to get it in place as fixing the right side unhinged the left and vice versa. In the end it never felt secure and continually slipped to the inside of my wrist or came unhinged.The clip itself if the most solid piece of the whole assembly, but doesn't save the setup from feeling cheap.Customer service was not impressive. I emailed them as directed on the website for a locked leaf but Amazon had processed my return before anyone responded to me and a trip to the BBB website showed me that I was not alone. I can't help but feeling that if customer service spent as much time responding to their customer's private emails as they do responding to public complaints, perhaps there wouldn't be so many.In the end I returned this and bought a FitBit Flex 2 with several aftermarket pendants and bands and still spent less.","Great idea, Meh execution",1

2017-02-14,"Love the design and overall look of this tracker, it's what sold me on this versus the fitbit I use to have.  I wish it had heartbeat tracking as well, but it does not.  I love the meditation and stress apps that come with it, i did not realize that this tracker would aggregate all my data and analyze how prone i was to stress and anxiety by reviewing my exercise, sleep schedule, meditation and menstrual cycle.  Quite a smart inclusion!  The bracelet and necklace are a bit cheap, but expected for the price.  I like the bracelet, but i find it hard to put on myself. The composite is awesome, pretty light weight and you can't tell its a health tracker at all.  LOVE that i dont have to charge a battery!! My old FitBit needed to be charged almost daily.  Also, I know this is why the battery lasts, but I wish it would sync simultaneously so i could go into the app and see my status anytime instead of having to click the sync button, but I suppose that's just as easy.  I wore to sleep for the first time last night and it told me when i woke up that it did not sense that I slept and didnt capture any data, so i had to enter it manually which was off.

The device retails for about $100 more. For the price point, I knew I had nothing to lose.My only gripe is that the included wrist band was not large enough for me to wear.I was concerned about the competition of two pendant-based wearables, but found a way that the Urban works as a slider pendant on a sterling silver neckband (see pics).

The app to sync data is very easy to use and helps you manage your progress towards goals like sleep, exercise, and meditation. While I originally got this to help me manage my stress, I was a bit disappointed that the stress predictor is simply based on how much sleep, exercise, meditation and woman's cycle--and you do not have a way to input data yourself about how you are feeling in terms of stress. There is an alarm feature---it vibrates--which is nice, however it could be improved: you can only set a few alarms right now and the vibration strength and frequency is not customizable (it would be nice to be able to differentiate between alarms so you can remember why it is vibrating & to increase the strength on alarms for those who are deep sleepers (It doesn't wake me up)).",Pleased with tracker,4

The Bellabeat has trumped them all in performance. It has minimized distractions by taking all your activity information and looking good- I wear mine as a bracelet. The App tracks all a woman needs in addition to ways to help you improve. I can concentrate on my lifestyle and know all my stats will be accounted for both as I sleep and on the go. It's nice not have to worry about charging it and taking it off to shower is ample time to let your skin breathe.

I have not had any issue with it falling off (i wear it on my wrist mostly, sometimes on my pant waistband) even while i was demoing a bathroom.

2021-07-08,"First off, to wear as a bracelet it is extremely difficult to put on by yourself with the “athletic band.” To try and get the large peg into the small pre-pinned holes is awful. It takes 10-15 minutes and a lot of struggle just to put it on. The fact it is only water resister to “splashes,” which I assume means hand washing is frustrating because now when I shower I have to struggle with the tiny band to get it on again. Actually considering returning it over this.Steps tracking seems fairly accurate. It’s frustrating that I have to manually sync its read *anything*. I understand this is to save battery but even a 12-hour or 24-hour auto sync would be beneficial for the price.It’s much thicker than the photos make it look. I would never wear it as a necklace, it’s gigantic. The fit is pretty bad. On one hole it’s so tight, it left marks on my wrist but the next it flops around.The directions list tell you to download the app. I have found the rest out through searching the internet. The app gives very little if any guidance. I only found out that it was actually working I just had to manually sync via searching.Overall, mehhh. Better looking than a Fitbit, enormous width compared, I don’t need a cycle tracker, I have an IUD and no cycle. I should always carry my phone and would get the same info. I won’t get the vibrate alarms but it fits so badly that’s not a benefit either.Good concept needs work.",Skip the hype,3

This is the first tracker I have owned. I made the decision to purchase the Leaf over other devices because its appearance. I knew I would not consistently wear a plastic band around my arm. Going with the Leaf meant sacrificing a read-out/screen on the device, but it is easy to sync and check my progress on my phone throughout the day. It's much more accurate at counting my steps than my phone's pedometer app. The only trouble I have had with it counting steps properly was when I forgot to change where I was wearing it in the app. Since there are multiple options for how to wear it during the day, t would be nice if this was simpler to do - more up-front in the app rather than clicking through to the settings.Perhaps I'm a bit of a data geek, but I would like to see more options for me to add information in the app (notes about sleep or my cycle especially). I (as a forty-something woman) would also love to see some additional options for tracking changes through Perimenopause.

2017-04-12,"I've had my Bellabeat tracker for about a week. I really like the look of the tracker. I like that you can choose between the clip,  bracelet,  and neclace. I've worn it as a necklace.  The nice thing about the chain is that it doesn't snag in my hair.  The downside of the necklace is that one night I tossed and turned and it didn't record my sleep.  The bracelet is ok, but I noticed that the clips on the bracelet straps are too loose resulting in the straps coming off of the tracker. It wasn't a deal breaker  because I closed the clips on the bracelet with a pair of pliers. I haven't tried the clip yet, but I plan on trying it eventually.I really like the way the app looks. I like the color scheme.  My only complaint is that it takes several steps to switch between modes. I would like it a lot better if the  modes were available on opening the app. I am way too rushed in the mornings to always remember to switch from bracelet to neclace modes.The period tracker is ok.

Customer service was great and helped me out with a replacement but the last two days, the unit is no longer tracking anything.  I have disconnected the unit from the app and re synced the unit but still nothing.  Attempted to re sync the unit again tonight and it is not responding and it is now claiming to be locked.

I just want to know how many steps I take in a day and monitor my sleep. I love my old school analog watch and even gave away my Apple watch because I missed my analog watch. So I bought the BellaBeat. It didn't track my sleep. It was having me asleep at times I was awake and vice versa. I tried wearing it on my wrist but it was constantly dragging on my desk at work. It worked best clipped to my clothes. Then I had major surgery and was home recuperating for three weeks and didn't wear it. When I picked it back up it no longer transmitted to my app. Now I just have a pretty rock. Only bought it in March 2021. Live and learn.,I tried. I really tried.,2
2021-07-24,"I was very excited when this came today. It is so pretty. However it ends there. I cannot get it to log steps accurately. I tested this in a variety of ways : sitting still, walking with placement in various locations, and against the fitbit. See below :Sitting in recliner with strapped to shirt, doing nothing for half an hour. 1500 steps. And earned 24 active minutes.Wearing on shirt, walked 100 steps. Counted 120.Wearing on bra, walked 100 steps. Counted 135.Wearing on pants, walked 300 steps. Counted 433.Each time I changed the placemnt of the bella, I went to settings and changed in the app where I was wearing it. Resynced each time. I manually counted each step.Walking around the block (not manually counting steps this time ) while wearing fit bit, the bella counted 800 more steps than the fit bit did.This thing is wholly innacurate. While I wish I could earn 1500 steps sitting in my recliner reading Facebook, it's just not possible.",Horrible.,1
2017-04-14,"I have had my Leaf Urban for two weeks and so far it is my favorite health tracker I have used. I have had two different FitBits (Flex and Charge HR) my problem with those were that they were not comfortable, and the battery had to be charged often.Not only is the Leaf more comfortable (and better looking) I have yet to have to charge it. In fact, the battery is still registering as full. Definitely the tracker for someone who is looking to make healthy changes in their life.",Favorite Health Tracker Yet,5
2017-03-24,This leaf is just great. Sometimes I completely forget it's on until someone says I have a beautiful bracelet. I like the sleep tracker but also the step tracker. It just helps me keep moving and then slowing down.,Urban Health Tracker,5

2017-03-02,"Let me start by saying I've only had this for a week.  I was very excited to be able to buy it on Amazon, can't beat same day delivery.  I have owned quite a few other fitness trackers and was never quite happy with them.  I wanted something that was not big and bulky and looked nice.  When I received it I was a little worried about the bracelet because the hooks do not close, however I haven't had any issues with it falling off and it feels secure.  Again I've only had it a week but so far so good, it's easy to sync, the app is user friendly, and it looks very pretty.  I would definetly recommend.  I will try and post another review after I've had some more time to use it but so far I am very happy with it.  I only gave it 4 stars due to the duration I've used it.",So far so good.,4
2021-09-22,I thought the tracker was cute. I wore it as a necklace but it is a little heavy. I had put it on my shirt but it would fall off (I nearly washed it twice). I would wear on my bra strap underneath my shirt and it would slip off. (I lost it once).So I wore it on my wrist. Within a couple days the leaf had gotten stuck on something and stretched out. I didn't like that the metal was so clunky.If you're not a busy mom who doesn't mind wearing jewelry (I generally don't wear jewelry) This might work for you. But it didn't work for me.The app is ok. But once the leaf stretched the whole system is useless. I ended up buying a Fitbit inspire.,Cute but clunky and broken,2
2017-09-08,"I do love my Bellabeat, much more stylish than the Fitbit products. But there are some things I wish were on the Bella, a display would be nice to maybe see step count instead of going to app to check out things. Would like to be able to purchase additional bracelets to swap out for different occasions. Noticing wear and tear with the one that came with it as I wear it CONSTANTLY. Would also like a way to acknowledge why no movement such as illness, etc. But overall a good product and I am happy I purchased.",I'm glad I purchased the Bellabeat.,4

2017-05-08,"This was a gift I asked for my birthday. I've had other ""trackers"" that really didn't Fit my life. The Leaf tracks activities that a mom does on a regular basis. You won't find me at a gym doing heavy duty workouts, but at home I clean, walk the dogs, play w/the kids and water aerobics with my friends. The only reason I didn't give a 5 in the ratings is it isn't waterproof. I actually tried to give it a 4.5 rating but it wasn't letting me do it. The Leaf is a pretty piece of jewelry but it helps me ( just a typical mom) keep track of my health with my lifestyle in mind.",Tracks my lifestyle,4
2017-03-14,"The Bellabeat Leaf Urban is gorgeous. I've only had it for just over a week, but I have worn it for a run (wrist), TaeKwonDo (clipped to t-shirt and/or sports bra), to sleep (wrist), to work (wrist and necklace), and out for the evening (wrist and necklace). It is comfortable and attractive. I have had no problems so far with it falling off during any activity. I am not yet 100% sure of the accuracy of ""steps"" readings in all of the various positions. I may get a pedometer to double check it, but I have the impression that it may not be getting all of my steps when it is worn as a necklace. If you are obsessed with your step numbers, it's probably not for you, but if you are looking at something to track your relative activity (and to remind you to do a little more), it's great. The app is easy to read and useful. I haven't used the meditation part (but I probably should). I like that I can enter various types of activities in, but I wish it had TaeKwonDo (had to substitute ""kickboxing""). The one thing the app is *really* missing is a way to track water intake. I think this could be a very easy fix and is one of the most important things that impacts health and wellness. I still use my fitbit app to track water (even though my fitbit died). I'd love to be able to track everything within the Leaf app. I'll update my review once I've had it for a bit longer, but I am very happy to have bought it.",Gorgeous and informative,5
2021-11-08,"The sleep tracking would indicate I was sleeping when I was just laying down. There seemed to be some kind of an interface between the sleep tracking and steps. If I turned the sleep tracking off, I could not get the steps to work properly. Sometimes it would not count steps for a half day but would then start counting them again. I do wish it had worked because it’s a lovely thing to wear. I do have jewelry that I prefer however. They were good about the return.",Beautiful and inconsistent.  We were not a match,3
2019-06-18,"The product is large & a bit clunky. I sent mine back bc I had so much trouble attaching it to my clothing. (I bought this precisely bc I needed something that I couldn’t lose. I had already lost 4 Misfit trackers).  That and the tracking is not very accurate. I wore an old Misfit tracker & this one simultaneously & this one did not track 1/2 the steps of my Misfit, which I was wearing on my ankle. (I wore the Bellabeat at my hip pocket.)  I did not care for the app for this either.  I like the idea, just not the follow through. Btw, the sellers were great about the return.",Not very accurate,2
2019-04-08,"It does not work well.  Had problems pairing.  The guide they have published is old.  The problems they know can occur isn't in the guide.  Customer service is horrible.  It does not track sleep well.  I can wake up walk around the house in middle of night and it will say I slept the entire night and won't log steps. I have even tried synching app when I wake up and nope it must think I do that in my sleep.I bought to track treadmill or walk in place steps.  It doesn't do great for that, but it will count steps in the car.The menstrual cycle tracking is a joke.  It basically tracks when you start and stop based on you hitting the buttom.  My calendar allows me to enter the same info PLUS info such as flow etc.Honestly it doesn't do anything well.  I have tried customer support and they have provided no help.  I am making do by using a few other apps thst are free.  But when I can afford to replace it I will.",Don't fall for the trap,1
2017-01-26,"I love the look of this fitness tracker, but it is not the same as a fitbit. First, it has GUIDED MEDITATION--lots of awesome guided meditations! I love this feature. It monitors stress and periods and can be worn lots of ways. I wore it with a fitbit and the step count is fairly accurate (they were within a hundred or so steps). One concern I have it that I lost the first one when I used it clipped to my waist. This was a reorder and I will wear it only as a bracelet or necklace. I did like it enough to reorder it though, so that is something. I also like the vibrating slams to remind me to take my vitamins or to wake up! It is not for someone looking for a Garmin (I wear that when I run a long with this) as it does not monitor heart rate or splits, but it does encourage movement and a healthy lifestyle.  I love it and recommend it.",Really pretty fitness tracker.,4
2016-12-23,"Even with all the holiday ordering backing up shipping (I was told this would arrive after several days after Christmas) this actually arrived at my door two days after the order was placed (three days before Christmas). It's pretty and lighter than the Leaf nature though I think the more modern look might not suit everyone. The app is really great and I love that you don't have to charge the Leaf. This is replacing my Fitbit One which I did love but I'm excited to have something a little more holistic, the only drawback that I see is no weight tracking with the Leaf but maybe it will be added later. Overall I am super excited about using my new Leaf!",Very excited! Super fast shipping!,4

2017-02-09,"My husband purchased the Bellabeat Urban for me for Christmas and I love it!  It took me a while to figure out how to use it and get accurate results.  I found that it's best to clip it to the body for more accuracy, so I wear mine clipped to my bra.  I never could figure out how to do the bracelet and the necklace, while pretty, didn't register steps properly.  But, I have used many different trackers over the years and the Urban is by far the best tracker once you get over the learning curve.","Great device, but not perfect",4
2017-05-11,"Love that it looks like a piece of jewelry.  No one really knows it's​ a fitness tracker.  Only thing would be knowing what fitness device has the most accurate calories burned. Wore 3 different devices, non had same final reading.",Luv it.,5
2021-07-13,"It makes a lovely piece of jewelry and I love the options for wearing it.  It took me a few attempts to get it working, and customer service was excellent.  But then all it really did fairly accurately was count my steps!  The sleep function was nowhere near accurate.  I can get the same functionality with a pedometer--and $80 is too much for a step counter!  I'm returning it--I appreciate not being stuck with it!  NOTE: I got ""rose gold"" and it's just regular gold--which is what I wanted anyway.  But if you're looking for rose gold, this isn't it: this is plain yellow gold.",Very pretty but doesn't do very much,2
2017-04-19,"First, nothing beats the Leaf in the asthetic aspect.  It doesn't look like I'm wearing a rubber weight on my wrist or second watch.  It looks like a trendy bracelet in my favorite metal of the moment, rose gold.  The options of wearing it as a bracelet, necklace or clip are unavailable on any other tracker.  I wear mine everyday for general step tracking, sleep tracking and reminders to take a minute and breathe.  I purchased mine after Jawbone was not responding to support requests for my UP3.I only have two complaints.  The first is accuracy.  When I wear the bracelet, my steps are grossly overestimated.  One day it recorded 23000 steps when I hadn't even gone for a walk.  I assumed this was because the bracelet was not tight enough.  However, making the bracelet one size smaller made it too tight and uncomfortable on my wrist.  When worn as a clip on my waistband, the recorded steps are accurate.Second, while it tracks my sleep, there is no smart alarm feature which I grew to love on my UP3.  This would allow the alarm to know when I was in my lightest stage of sleep making the waking up process easier.Overall, this is a great tracker for women.  Allows me to have one app for my health tracking needs.  I will be looking into accessories to see if there is a bracelet that may fit me better.",Great looking tracker!,4

The first one started malfunction and I felt like I was going in circles with the customer service rep. Finally, through my determination, I got them to send a new one in June. However, now my new leaf has gone missing. I know I most likely lost it while sleeping in my bed, but cannot find it and it’s not picking up on the Bluetooth finder app Bellabeat suggests or any other Bluetooth app. I know it has a full battery and I realized I lost it within a couple hours. I’ve asked Bellabeat if they could activate it or send some sort of signal so I may track it, but they do not have that ability. I feel bad for anyone who works for their customer service because their policies and capabilities are extremely frustrating and they try to rip off their customers.",Disappointing customer service.

2019-03-01,"I purchased this product for its step counting ability with IOS.  I have had my leaf for a few weeks now.  I wear it as a bracket to get the full advantage of the features.  However,  the step count is in accurate during the night.  I am a restless sleeper and it’s odd to see 1000+ steps during my sleep hours.  No I do not sleep walk.  I still have to relay on carrying my phone for the most accurate reading.  I do wish there was a heart monitor feature to complete this product.  I wear it 24 hours a day, showering is not a problem.  I did not invest in the water bottle.  I can count with my regular bottles.  The Stress monitoring is new for me as I do not  meditate.

2017-05-15,"Really am liking my Bellabeat. App features are great. Step tracking isn't spot on but reasonably close. I mostly bought it to track my sleep patterns. It isn't always accurate but relatively close. I don't like is when you adjust the went-to-bed or wake-up time the app automatically erases the sleep cycle (interrupted sleep) in between and just notes it as peaceful rest.Also, you aren't able to add daily caloric intake. Although that's not a deal breaker for me.The bracelet is very pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it. I even like to wear it as a jewelry accessory. The downside is that it is difficult to put on, you can't shower with it (to the best of my knowledge), after a month the strap showed much wear, and finally it came apart and I lost half of the strap. I'd love if they had a rubber bracelet option that was easier to put on and if the leather one was more secure.All-in-all this has been a nice addition to my lifestyle.",Love my Bella but it could use a few tweaks,4

2017-07-02,"To understand my rating you should know that the reason I wanted a fitness tracker was really I wanted a fancy pedometer. I am on the move a decent amount and while my phone served well the pedometer features weren't as precise as I'd like and ran down the battery. Enter BellaBeat. I was excited about the additional features that would come with the app, like the sleep tracking and the meditation goals, but I was really let down. While the added features are neat, the pedometer didn't work well at all. I went on a 45 minute walk and the thing didn't track a single step. While the other features were ok, the device simply couldn't perform what I really wanted it to do. So, I returned it.

I didn't feel like I would wear the other fitness devices with dress clothes or to formal events. I can certainly wear the Leaf. Additionally, I really like that I can switch from a necklace to a bracelet to a clip on. I also like that it can monitor breathing during meditation and offer tracking of your reproductive cycles.As far as cons go, a few times it has failed to track steps for a few hours (not sure why) which is disappointing.

It would register my walk as a little more than 2 1/2 miles.

It does seem to be a little more generous with steps than other trackers, but that also could be due to the fact that I always wear it on my wrist. The only reason for giving it only four stars is that the battery life seems to be a bit short. I got this less than a year ago and I've already had to replace the battery twice.

I've worn it as a necklace a few times, and the last time I did (while sleeping), the leaf somehow fell off of the chain - I think stringing the chain through the hole on the other end would probably solve that problem.I wasn't a big fan of the tan leather strap that came with it - I would have preferred black, but I ended up making a new strap of my own after grabbing some materials at the craft store.Overall, I love the leaf and would definitely recommend it!",Would definitely recommend!,4

I so far enjoy the battery power- no forgetting to charge it and go days without wearing it. The integrated meditation and period tracker is awesome.

I don't sleep well and I've noticed the time when I wake up and the Bellabeat has had the correct time.My only complaint is that it can slip off.

The period tracker is wonderful for someone trying to track there cycle and if you mess up entering  the date or stop it short you can fix it. Most of the meditation simulations that I tried have helped me alot with relaxing and what's nice is most of them have two different time lengths, so if your in a rush you can still meditate.Cons:I wish there was some way to set the celabration on the steps, you get very different results when you wear it at the different places. I also wish that they would add to the app your daily water intake, I know that sounds silly but it is extremely important to drink your water.In conclusion, I'm thrilled with my leaf and the cons would not deter me from recommending this product to other woman.",Love it...,4

2021-05-11,"I really really wanted to love this but it is disappointing on so many levels. You have to manually sync which is silly especially if it doesn’t sync all the data from the last sync, so if you don’t sync daily you lose your data and from what I can see the app you can’t amend that either. The bracelet is silicone-y and I received it torn and is now broken after less than 2 months ofwearing. Lastly the actual leaf is much bigger and higher than I anticipated - reason I bought it - was to not “broadcast” that I am tracking my steps and looking for insights with a tacky device - only plus is that it is pretty - but not much use if I actually can’t easily get a replacement.",Disappointing considering what you pay and the app is restrictive,2
2017-12-26,"I wanted to love this tracker, but honestly for the cost, there are better options. This device is barely shower proof. It stopped working after only one week. I also noticed the steps weren’t accurate, it was double than my phone step count AND w cheaper brand fitness tracker. I emailed The company inquiring if they’ll release a real water proof device and they said no time soon. Overall, not worth the price. I am enjoying a $25 tracker I found here on Amazon.",Not really splash proof,3

I had to manually enter it in as naps and it just seemed to defeat the purpose. When entered manually it also didn't do any sort of analysis.The bracelet started to stretch and I would catch the leaf becoming loose and almost falling offIt didn't automatically sync (or prompt me) after I set alarms and I stopped using it after a few times of forgetting to sync",Ultimately disappointed,3
2017-02-13,"I got the Leaf Urban for my wife. She is still getting used to it but her favorite part about it is that with the watch battery, she doesn't have to charge it every couple of days. She would prefer to wear it on the wrist band but hasn't managed to use is that way, and at any rate doesn't trust the clips that hold it in place. It looks nice and she is happy to have a water resistant fitness tracker.

2017-02-09,Love the BellaBeat Urban...just had to change the battery and it was simple.  It only lasted 4 months...I will see how long this battery lasts.  The only thing I miss is the Hr monitor but as the other trackers HR monitors are not accurate it is not a big deal.  I get a ton of compliments and it is easy to use and wear.  I also love the period tracker..I suffer from migraines which are hormonally triggered.  I am in menopause so the period tracker is a god to see how regular/irregular I am.,Love my BellaBeat,4
2017-03-31,"I am loving my Leaf so far (had it just about a month).  I only have minor suggestions for this product.  I stopped wearing it on my pants as it fell off when I would go to the bathroom (it actually fell in the toilet but I was able to put in in a bowl of rice for two days and it has been working fine).  I wear it clipped on my bra every day.  I don't feel that the bracelet is secure enough to keep it on, but there are lots of stores on Etsy that sell bracelets that have clips on both ends.  I like the gentle vibration reminders to get up and move if I have been sitting too long.  I love the look way better than the other fitness trackers I have had in the past.  It would be nice if it integrated with MyFitnessPal.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",I like the gentle vibration reminders to get up and move ...,4
2017-03-14,"I love the rose gold design of the Bellabeat Leaf Urban and how easily it can be synced with the related app.  I limited my review to four stars instead of five because: (1) I'd prefer a bracelet option in a vegan-friendly material. The wrap around bracelet design it comes with is lovely, but one that isn't the product of a slaughter would be preferred. (2) The ability to capture my pulse would be a great feature and make the Stress tracker tool more accurate.",On the right track,4
2017-09-09,"One star for being pretty and not as athletic-looking as other trackers.  Minus four for being AWFUL at accuracy.  I get tons of compliments on how cute it is, but cute doesn't do anything for me when it doesn't function like it should.It constantly majorly undercounts my steps.  For example, I just walked 7.5 miles, got home and my Leaf says I took 6k steps.  Based on my stride length and distance walked it should be more like 21k.  But, standing completely still this morning, playing on my phone, not making any wild arm movements, it registered 800 steps.  I get up and walk to the kitchen and back (~150 steps) and it doesn't count anything.  I have tried all orientations of wearing it, and it's still wildly inaccurate.  SO infuriating.This past week, on vacation, I walked pretty much constantly for 3 hours exploring a city and museums.  Sat down at a restaurant after 3.5 hours of activity, and my Leaf immediately started the inactivity vibrating.  Unsurprisingly, my steps were majorly underestimated based on distance walked, which leads me to believe it hadn't registered any of my activity over the previous 1.5 hours (my setting for inactivity alarm).  Frequently at work, after just walking to the restroom or printer (~200 steps round trip), I get the inactivity alarm.  Not sure how it's configured to calculate activity, but it's not accurate.The wrist band that comes with this one is not easy to use, takes up a large amount of real estate on my petite wrist, and, when fastened, either cuts off my circulation or is loose enough for the Leaf to unclip.  I made a new beaded bracelet for it that looks nice and fits better.  But it's additional money shelled out for something that should be useful out of the box at this price.I am so frustrated and angry that I shelled out the money for this and will now have to shell out more to buy a tracker that actually works.",Save your money for a tracker that works,1

2017-10-13,"Fashionable piece of jewelry and helpful tracking. The only issue is that sometimes it falls off of the strap (I have small wrists too, so I have it almost on the tightest options). I wish the other straps weren't quite as expensive as they are very pretty and would make this much more versatile. I have tried the necklace, but don't find it to be as attractive or seemingly useful. I'll try it again though as I do like having another option for when I want to wear another bracelet.

2018-02-15,"There are several things I really liked about the Bellabeat:- the versatility of wearing it several ways- incorporation if breathing exercises and meditation into the app- being able to wear to on a night out and not feeling like it clashed with my outfitUnfortunately, I can’t rate it higher than 3 stars for the following reasons:- the app is not as intuitive or versatile as other fitness tracker apps I’ve used- even though you can change the way you wear it, it is not exactly easy/fast to do so. The double bracelet is stylish but very difficult to put on one handed. Given my routine, I needed to change how I was wearing it multiple times a day.- the clip feature comes with a warning not to clip the tracker on thick fabric because it will stretch out. This happened to me anyway because my backpack strap would get caught in the clip when I would take my backpack off. The clip quickly stretched out and the tracker fell off and got lost. Losing it this way was a real shame because I had only had it for about a month.I know some of these issues are specific to me and how I used the product, so they may not be an issue for others. I can’t fully endorse it however, given that it didn’t work for my needs.I hope the makers of the bellabeat listen to their customers feedback and continue to improve on the design.",Some pros but needs improvements to be truly versatile.,3

2017-02-14,"I was very excited to get this tracker as it had different features from my Fitbit Blaze. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed. When I opened the package I pulled the tab to activate it and it didn't activate. I thought the battery was dead. I went to the store and purchased a new battery. When I followed the instructions to open the back of the device, I noticed a rip or hole next to the top hole where the screw was and the battery was not in the correct position. I placed the battery where it belonged and the device did activate but the rubber seal came with a hole in it where it is not supposed to be. I contacted customer service to see if I could get a replacement seal and they said they don't have them. Now I have to take the device apart again to take a picture of the damage to see what they can do for me. So much hassle for a device I just received yesterday. I haven't even had the chance to try all of the features. I was disappointed also to find out you have to constantly sync the device manually, it doesn't do it on its own like the Fitbit. You also have to manually add your information for your period and such. It's pretty, but I'm very unhappy about the damage it came to me with and I can't even replace the piece.I am pleased to add an update. Customer service contacted me about my issue once they saw my review. I received a brand new leaf, an extra accessory, and a gorgeous glass water bottle for the trouble.

I have had the 2nd 1 now for just over 13 months and my husband was tired of me complaining about it and bought me an Apple Watch.

I've never been one for meditation before I wore this, but I have discovered I really enjoy the guided meditations included on the app. The only draw back for me is that I work night shift and it does not automatically log the quality of sleep I get (I have to manual enter how long I've slept); I asked the company about it and they said they're working on it and will be part of a future update.",Beautiful and functional,4

2017-03-14,"I like my rose gold urban leaf health tracker so much, I bought one for my best friend.Pros: Definitely doesn't look like a fitness tracker and goes with my work clothes nicely. Love that it includes guided meditations to help facilitate regular practice. Accurate sleep assessment. The stress meter is interesting. Allows you to record many activities as exercise--even ones not typically considered to be exercise like cooking, playing with kids, giving massages, cleaning, and sex.Cons: As noted by another person, it seems like steps are under-counted. I can barely get 10,000 steps walking almost 5 miles to/from work in a day. Also, I entered in ""shoveling snow"" as an activity today, and the steps that had been attributed to that activity were then reduced to look like the activity didn't actually involve taking steps!Other gripes include that the software isn't always intuitive (I've had to look up how to set movement alarms), and the movement alarms are not actually linked with you moving. Yesterday I walked to work, sat down, and 5 minutes later the bracelet buzzed telling me to move.Finally, the bracelet can be difficult to put on because of the gaps in the loops. An easy way the company could fix this would be to have spring-loaded loops (like tiny carabiners) instead.",Like it enough that I bought one for my best friend.,4

The first one I purchased fell out of my pants a couple of times, so I purchased a second one, thinking I could have damaged the first one when I dropped it, and I did not drop the second one, I was extreme careful.

So far, after wearing it for a week, I am satisfied.A few comments:(1) it took a few tries to get the app and device to connect. I found the help available through the app did actually help (it recommended rebooting my phone which did the trick in my case).(2) I wear mine primarily as a bracelet and I had to watch a YouTube video to get the hang of how to wrap and fasten the included leather strap around my wrist. After a bit of practice, I can do it fairly easily now.(3) The app is easy to use and though the device and app do not sync automatically, initiating the synchronization is not a big deal for me.My only gripe so far, and the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the app is not available in the Kindle Fire app store.

2017-03-29,"So overall I think this a beautiful women's health tracker. I like the design and the versatility of the tracker. Before getting this as a birthday gift I wore a garmin tracker that monitored sleep, counted steps, kept track of calories burned, as well as being 100% waterproof. Now comparing the two I've noticed that the sleep tracker is not always as accurate on the leaf. I'm not sure if the accuracy comes more as it learns your routines and your body or not. As far as the leaf I feel that it does not accurate track steps. Wearing it as the bracelet I feel it is more accurate than the necklace for sure. I think this inaccuracy is a downfall. Moving on to the accessories I love the necklace (besides it not tracking correctly) but the bracelet does not work for me. I have to wear it tightly so that the leaf does not come unattached and that setting is just too tight unfortunately. Also the bracelet being made of leather can be a down fall in itself since it is leather and it can stretch. I ended up fashioning my own bracelets that are more secure. Other than that I love the idea of the meditation (I haven't had the opportunity to use it but I know eventually I will) as well as the stress tracker. I like how it gives you more of a window into your life to help you minimize the stress in your life in the categories you can control. I also love the cycle tracker. I was able to get rid of another tracker app I was using on my phone because of this. I also love the insight for the ovulation and fertile days so as my husband and I plan to grow our family we can help use this as a guide.

I just didn't really need the intensive one I have; it's not really ""pretty"" and it's really too big for a smaller wrist like mine.  I haven't had any issues with syncing like I've seen on other reviews.  And the vibration is not too light; it wakes me up at 3:45 am like I tell it to.  If it can work to get me up that early, it can work to get anyone else up at a more decent hour.  My only complaint so far is the current design of the bracelet.  I wish it had lobster claws for clasps or something like that instead of being open.  When I wear it tight, it doesn't fall off.  But when I wear it one hole looser, which is more comfortable, it has fallen off twice because the always-open clasp works its way undone.  A suggestion for an improvement on the bracelet attachment is to have clasps that close.  Otherwise, it seems like a good product so far.  I added a few pictures to show size.  I have a pretty small wrist.  I put one in with my watch on as well to show size comparison with other jewelry one may wear.",Good product so far.,4
2017-02-02,Love this health tracker! The necklace is so perfect. Unfortunately the bracelet is so small it wont fit my wrist! In fact I tried it on my 12 year old and it was even too small for her.

2017-02-02,"I received my leaf a couple of weeks ago. I am pretty happy with my purchase.  I had been wearing a Fitbit prior to this and I didn't always like having it on my wrist.  I like having the ability to wear it as a clip or a necklace as well since my wrists are small.  The one issue I have is it really isn't accurate with the sleep tracking.  Sometimes it says I slept for more hours then I actually did.  It does ask if the info is correct and you can change it, but it's wrong more then it's right.

2017-05-24,"I really like the Bellabeat Leaf.  I've received tons of compliments on it.  I find it pretty accurate, more or less.  The only thing that I do not like is the style of bracelet.  The leaf can easily slip off the bracelet as the openings to the ends of the bracelet are wider than they should be.  A recommendation from me would be to update the bracelet to one that can be perhaps easily locked in place.  Maybe add a lobster claw type of closing.  I don't wear the bracelet outside because of this issue of it easily coming off.  The bracelet is also a pain to put on.  Other than that, I like the product.",Really like the Bellabeat Leaf,4

I have used some of the quick meditations while I'm out and about and enjoy the sessions each time.  I get compliments every time I wear the Leaf as a necklace.  It looks beautiful with anything!

2017-02-14,"I bought the Urban Leaf to replace my Fitbit One after it developed a problem where it would turn off for no reason and not track my steps (and customer service was not very helpful because it was over 1 year old). I wanted a fitness tracker that had a clip because I have tendinitis in my non-dominant wrist and it usually hurts to wear something everyday. My Leaf arrived one week ago and I have been wearing it and my Fitbit to compare. Some other reviewers said that their Fitbits logged more steps than the Leaf; on days when I mostly moved around the house or got up between long periods of sitting, my Fitbit logged more steps. However, on the weekend, I went on a long walk a few times and went shopping - my Leaf actually tracked 500 more steps than my Fitbit did (and on this day, my Fitbit did not power off for no reason).So far, I really like the Leaf. I have worn it as both a clip and as a bracelet. The bracelet took me a while to figure out. I had to watch a video, but now I can put it on fairly quickly. Another reviewer mentioned that the clip tends to ride up or fall off if you have it on the waistband of your pants. I have noticed this as well, but my Fitbit clip did the same thing, so I think it might just be something inevitable about clips. I think if you are aware of it and check to make sure it doesn't fall off when you go to the bathroom, this is not a big issue. I like the way the Leaf looks as a bracelet; however, you have to make sure it is tight enough to not fall off during the day. Mine did fall off once, but I tightened it by one rung and have not had this issue since. It is lightweight enough for me to wear on my wrist with tendinitis, but not every day.I also really like the sleep tracking ability. My Fitbit One also had this, but I rarely used it because you had to sleep with it in this mesh wristband which I found uncomfortable. It was too bulky to wear on your waist to sleep unless you sleep on your back. In contrast, I can sleep with the Leaf on my waistband without any discomfort because it is pretty flat.I like that the app has period tracking as well. It is nice to have all in one place.The one thing I know I will miss from Fitbit is the social aspect (the step ranking with your friends). It would be really nice if one day the iOS health app developed something similar with compatibility with different devices. So far, I am enjoying the Leaf. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fitness tracker that doesn't look like a fitness tracker.",Loving the Leaf so far!,4
2017-03-20,"I am loving this piece!  Everything seems pretty spot on and it's so easy to use.  Sometimes the double tap didn't seem to work,  and the app could use a spot to log water intake and food consumption,  but otherwise I'm extremely pleased with my leaf.",Love it!,4
2018-06-18,"Love my Urban!  I wear it every day on my wrist.  It does a great job tracking my steps and sleep.  I do wish the Bella Beat did track blood pressure and heart rate, but maybe in the future models.",Step tracker that looks like jewelry,4
2021-10-14,"Aside from it being much more of a clunky/chunky thing than it looked, I was optimistic about it. I found it got the best accuracy when I just put it in my pocket (and it didn't fall off every step either), but then, what's the point of paying for something pretty if its just going to be shoved in your pocket...Either way, it was working pretty great and I enjoyed tracking my steps, until 5 days ago when it stopped synching up. After several attempts and an attempt to re-pair the device, I'm done with it. Barely got 5 months of use. Not worth your money or your frustrations. Skip it.Update: after weeks of rounds of emails and waiting, I received a new Leaf at no cost and guess what? Still not worth it. New one still has issues and accuracy is awful.",Disappointed.,1

I am still getting accustomed to my Leaf, but so far so good!  I am finding the sleep tracker is pretty accurate and I have not had the time to meditate (unfortunately).  The stress tracker is interesting - sometimes I wonder if it feels more stress than I do!My one concern is with the wrap bracelet - when I take off my bracelet to shower (wish it was waterproof), I have found my Leaf falling off the bracelet due to the gaps in the link. So, I am in the process of looking for another bracelet since that is my preferred choice of wear.  All in all - I don't even know I have it on!!!",I like it!!,4
2017-03-28,"So far, I am really enjoying my bellabeat. It is attractive, comfortable and easy to use. It would be useful to be able to add in mediation done independently of the bellabeat app, just as you can enter naptimes and duration on the sleep section.FYI I am a post menopausal woman. Obviously I knew when I purchased my bellabeat that I would not be using the track my cycle feature. I am wondering if a section for symptoms of menopause, hot flashes, night sweats etc could be added. I track those symptoms and notice a possible correlation to stress, sleep etc and occurrence  and intensity of symptoms. In addition reminders to increase meditations and exercise when symptoms have occurred would be helpful.And finally the urban silver looks great with the back bracelet , could a black 2 strand bracelet with silver findings be offered?",So good I have ideas for additions.....,4
2017-05-18,"I LOVE my leaf. I just had a baby and my husband knew I was excited to get back in shape, so he bought me this for Mother's Day. I love that it tracks steps and sleep and is so geared toward women. It even has Breastfeeding listed as an activity! The only thing that could make the leaf better is if it had a small clock on it somewhere. I'm wearing it on my wrist instead of my regular watch and I miss being able to see the time without getting out my phone.",Only missing the time,4
2017-02-09,"I am so glad Bellabeat came out with the Urban! I wanted a Leaf when they came out with Nature but I don't really wear jewelry because I'm clumsy and catch on things, or knock them on tables and break them so the Nature just seemed clunky to me and the whole wood backing is not really a part of my aesthetic. The Urban is so sleek and the way it clips onto clothing makes it a pretty accessory and easy to hide. The water resistant feature is helpful as well because I've definitely hopped in the shower after a workout a couple times without thinking and left it on my wrist. The meditation feature has been really helpful when I'm stressed. I've never been one for meditation, but my Lead has really got me into it and I've noticed a difference in my mental health.The Leaf is definitely less cumbersome than I thought, and the stone on the Urban is really pretty. I do social dancing, and like to clip it to the shorts or tights I wear under my dress if I don't have it on my wrist.  I've seen a couple other women there who have Leafs and we like to compare our stats in the app and count the steps when we have a particularly vigorous dance. I just wish the app had a friends/challenge option like Fitbit and Jawbone so we could link up. A heart rate and better movement sensors would be helpful as well.I only have two major complaints that keep this product from being 5 stars. The first is that I only really get good movement activity readings if its on my wrist, and good step count if its clipped to my pants. Sleep only gets tracked if its on my wrist. There's not really an overlap. If I clip it to my shirt or hip, there are certain HIIT workouts I do that it won't register! The necklace method doesn't track ANYTHING accurately (it likes to say I never sleep) and its not really practical for movement or sleeping. I really don't want to be hit in the face by a battery-powered rock or suffocate in my sleep from a chain around my neck. Clipped to my wrist, a casual walk doesn't always register on the counter, but clipped to my waist, if I'm walking, it has a tendency to work itself off of my waistband and disappear. I've nearly lost my Leaf twice out shopping before I got wise to this. More accurate readings in any position would be appreciated so I could take advantage of all the ways to wear. Frankly it's uncomfortable to wear a tight bracelet with a stone directly against my skin constantly.The second issue I have is that motion tracking through the app is not detailed enough. As a pedometer and a motion prompter, this is great. For people looking to get moving more in general, I'm sure it's very helpful. But for people who do a lot of high intensity, detailed, varied workouts daily, there aren't enough options in the ""add an activity"" feature to accurately track my workouts and accurately gauge the calories burned in a day. If I do weight lifting for 20 minutes with my arms, there is NO WAY that 324 calories is an accurate read. Just like logging Insanity or P90X as 30 minutes of Circuit Training isn't accurate. I'm going to wind up having to get a FitBit anyway just to get an accurate read on my physical activity.If working out is your thing and you want detail and precision in your movement data: get a fitbit/jawbone. If you want a cute simple device/pedometer that tracks your period and gives you some fun guided meditation/breathing exercises and a gentle reminder to move every so often: the Leaf is great.",Starter Tracker in Cute Accessory Form,4

2017-03-08,"The leaf itself is very nice, but the software it runs on it TERRIBLE. Syncing is a problem with several devices, so my wife has to use her phone and iPad to make it all come together. The two devices don't seem to know that she's using the same leaf - they call them different things, and don't seem to correctly align the data pulled from the tracker. Alarms are not syncing between her phone and iPad and the battery level is reporting incorrectly (brand new batteries show as dead for a couple days and then suddenly update to being fully charged) It'd be cool if this tracker could work with apps she likes better. Also the wristband is a pain to put on by yourself. Between that and the software issues, my wife was quite disappointed with the initial experience.",Poor User Experience,3

It also doesn't compare with the distance cited by a treadmill. That inaccuracy is for me a huge deal breaker. Why buy something that looks fashionable but does not gather data correctly?

2017-02-11,"*****update*****I bought my bellabeat in February of 2017.  I originally paid about $150 and have loved it for the last year+ but in the last 30days it's only tracking my sleep and steps intermittently.  I did NOT expect to spend so much on something with such a short shelf life.  The trouble shooting suggests that it is the android device I'm using or the battery.  I've replaced the battery.  I've synced with my boyfriend's phone and my iPad.  I'm really annoyed that I wasted so much money for just a year and a couple of months.  I wouldn't buy this again and I don't suggest anybody waste their money.  See pro's in my original refiew below:Bellabeat Urban was the perfect fit for my want of a wearable that didn't look like some goofy plastic watch or wristband I wore as a kid.  I chose the Urban because it's water resistant, but when it came in the mail it did specify to spray, not submersion.  I'm the type to put a piece of jewelry on and never take it off.  I was trying to be mindful, but this morning I realized I forgot to take it off before my shower, yet it did survive!  I'm really appreciating the guided meditations.  It's not something I'd previously included in my fitness goals but I can see the correlation to my stress level with the tracker.  Tracking my steps and sleep is also helping me be more mindful in achieving the goals I've set for being active and getting enough rest.  Most importantly it's pretty and can be worn in a variety of ways unlike most comparable products available.","VERY short shelf life, not worth the high price tag for only a year of use.",1

2017-02-10,"I just received my Leaf Urban a couple of days ago and so far so good.  I had an UP24 for a few years and liked the product and app...unfortunately it was ugly in my opinion.  The band then started to fail and I went through several replacements, app crashes, etc. before I gave up and began looking for another option.  The Leaf Urban caught my eye because it is a very pretty jewelry option as opposed to the other trackers out there.  I'm still learning my way around the product and the app. There are a couple of things I'm not crazy about so far...you can't edit your sleep as accurately as I could with my previous band.  The step accuracy is questionable at times, plus I miss the intensity tracking of my UP.  (It's possible this is just due to my unfamiliarity with the app at this point). The alarms are nice...both inactivity and sleep.  I'm a light sleeper and wake up before anyone else in the house so the vibration is a nice option.  I'm sure with time this product and app will continue to improve and I looked forward to seeing and experiencing those changes.",... a couple of days ago and so far so good. I had an UP24 for a few years ...,4
2020-07-23,Not accurate and doesn't always track.  At first it worked fine.  After a few months it started not tracking and then not syncing and now it's just a pretty piece of jewelry.  I've contacted support several times and they haven't been helpful either.  I'm so frustrated and disappointed because troubleshooting all the issues I've been having with this device is time consuming and annoying.  I'm now looking at other brands.,Pretty but useless,2
2017-01-27,"First off the step counter:The first day I wore it I did end up walking a lot, but no where near 20,000 steps. The second day I had even more than that and I feel like I walked less than the day before! Today I have been testing how the leaf tracks. I was wearing it on my left wrist (I am right handed) and sitting at the computer at work. Somehow, while sitting at the computer for 20 minutes, I have walked 200 steps. It must count my hand movements when I am typing, which doesn't require a lot of wrist movement. I have switched it to my waistband and have been purposely moving quite a bit in my chair to see if it will detect my movements. Surprisingly it didn't detect anything. I walked down the hall and back and counted my steps (40 steps) and the leaf detected 18.Next is the sleep tracker:It seems to be dead on at tracking when I fall asleep. However, if you wake up during the night to go to the bathroom or get a drink (I have a puppy that has to go out once or twice a night) it tracks this as your wake time and doesn't record if you fall back asleep. You can manually fix this on your phone if you want a correct wake time.Overall it is a cute little tracker and the clip is nice and secure when clipping it to your shirt or pants. The accuracy of steps needs a lot of work for it to be more useful. The app has drained my phone battery today but I have been syncing it a lot to track how accurate the step tracker is. I haven't tried the meditation or period tracker because I bought it to track steps and sleep so I cannot comment on those.",Cute and stylish but not very accurate.,3
2017-01-15,"I don't like the look of a fitbit or other activity trackers.  The Urban Leaf is attractive and accurate when compared to my Garmin.  I like being able to add meditation and other activities to my activity tracker.  The leather band it comes with is a little tricky.  Its unlikely I will wear it as a necklace or clip it to my clothing.  It's likely I'll purchase another band for the tracker.

The app is easy to use and has  nice graphics and motivational messages.I have a slightly larger wrist so would've loved the option to get m/l band.  I was able to barely get the s/m on and gently stretch it and it has gotten more comfortable in the past week.  The chain works nicely for a necklace and it clips anywhere as needed.On my wrist I find that it tracks more steps than my fitbit (i've been wearing  both for now).  On the necklace it tracked fewer steps than my fitbit, which I always have clipped to my bra.  The sleep tracking seems accurate as well.  I am not using the cycle tracker option.",Happy with this purchase.,4

Bummed.",Unhappy,2
2017-03-31,"I have a STRIIV fitness tracker which I liked except for having to recharge it.  The Leaf eliminates this by using a watch battery.  This feature  has been helpful as I work two jobs and wouldn't have accurate data due to charging times.  Also,  the vibrating alarm is a big feature for me.  I have a hard time waking up and I have inside jobs.  This feature has activity reminders as well as wake-up alarms.So far the features seem to be fairly accurate. The steps may be a bit fewer than the actual,  but,  there is also no calibration.  If this device ""learns"" it will probably get more accurate over time.  The stress and meditation features are great.  They allow some interesting insights. The guided meditation is great for when you need a break.The company is very receptive to suggestions to improve the product.  I have already sent one regarding activities.  It would be nice if you added abdominal workouts. It would also be nice if you would add programs (think beachbody). I have never seen a fitness tracker with this.  These programs are extremely popular...One of my favorite things about the leaf is the look.  It looks like jewelry.  This does not take a dressy outfit and make it look more casual like so many other trackers.Other commentators have stated the bracelet fell off.  I have the double wrap bracelet.  I had it happen the first day... turns out I had it too loose.  This was allowing too much slack which allowed out to slip out of the loops.  I dont wear it overly tight,  but,  making a one notch adjustment fixed the issue.

2017-03-27,"I got this as a gift from my boyfriend for our anniversary. I had been looking into it for awhile. Overall I am satisfied with the Leaf Urban. I was unsure if I could wear it with every outfit, since I wear both silver and gold. On days I don't want to wear it as jewelry (bracelet or necklace), it is quite simple to clip it onto one of my clothing items I am wearing and it is very discrete. The more I use the clip function, the more I've had it fall off, although it is still rare for it to fall off (usually if I am doing rigorous activity). It is very easy to use. I like the app because it combines results from activity, sleep (when I wear it clipped on my shirt), meditation, and my period to tell me how sensitive I might be to stress on a given day. If there's a certain day Bellabeat says I am more sensitive to stress, I can use that information to focus on my mental health, maybe adding in a meditation or getting more physical activity, for example. Eventually, I would like to get a smart watch which I think would take over some functions of the leaf, but unlike a smart watch the leaf can track your sleep (because it's comfortable to wear over night) and the app can use the movement tracking to calculate stress. I have also very much liked the meditations provided on the leaf app. So, if you are someone who wants to more closely monitor your sleep, physical activity, mental health, and menstrual cycle, I recommend this product",Recommended for stress monitoring,4

I also wish I had more freedom to set alarms, I love the built in meditation in the app but I wish my bellabeat could be set to buzz 2-3x a day to remind me to take some deep breaths.

2017-02-09,"I've been pretty happy with my Bellabeat Leaf. My biggest complaint is that the strap occasionally comes undone from the tracker, and the whole thing will fall off - but it's big enough that it's very obvious when this happens. I came to the Leaf after using a Misfit Shine (2 of them) and my biggest complaint with the Shine was that it would fall out of the wristband.I like the app; it's pretty easy to navigate and although I haven't used all of its functions yet, it's pretty readable. I believe the step tracker to be pretty accurate - and this is the first time I've ever bothered to use a period tracker, simply because it's already there & easy to access.

I wish Bellabeat would switch out the open hooks for claps with closures, but that is my only negative. I've received complements from coworkers and family because the Leaf is beautiful and I'm proud to wear it.I've worn other fitness trackers, and the Leaf seems to be the most accurate of any I've tried. I like the sleep tracker and the guided meditation. My favorite thing, though, is that I don't have to charge the Leaf.

2017-02-09,"There is no doubt that the leaf is the most beautiful tracker on the market.As a tracker it has its pros and cons.The versatility of the tracker is great, it's really useful to clip it to yourself if you're doing a workout or other activity where a moving tracker could impede you.The bracelet position is undoubtedly the most accurate. Unfortunately the design of the bracelet is poor with two open clips for attachment instead of traditional lobster clasps. The size of my wrist means that the bracelet can, and has fallen off my wrist before. I have now attached lobster clasps and and squeezed the openings closed.The other flaw is the alarm which is weak to say the least and barely lasts a few seconds. However, you can get around this by setting the alarm multiple times in quick succession.The stress feature is neither here nor there as it's a reflection of your activities not your actual mood/stree but I suppose having an idea of how sensitive you may be to stress may be useful to some.My favourite feature is the meditation. There is a good variety of different types of meditation and most of these come in two lengths which I find useful.I have found the period tracker fairly accurate and useful.The sleep tracker can be a bit hit and miss depending how wild you sleep but overall I find that it is correct.This is a very different type of tracker compared to something like a Jawbone or fitbit as there is much more focus on wellbeing rather than just steps. The leaf doesn't track heart rate, exercise (apart from basic steps) or have gps tracker so if you're looking specifically for a fitness tracker that monitors and encourages you then this is probably not for you. The leaf provides small encouragement but mainly it is a beautiful recorder of information that use to encourage yourself.It's an expensive product but for me it's worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in their health and wellness.",Beautiful and functional,4

2017-03-28,Can't get this to actually track anything! The app says I've done nothing which isn't accurate and the only way to access this is through the app. It is very nice looking but If it isn't accurate and doesn't track anything then what's the point?

2017-04-05,Although this is beautiful I really disliked this.  If you want anything more than a basic pedometer this is worthless.  First of all I wore both my fitbit and the leaf.  The leaf added an extra 9000 steps. The period tracker is too simple.  You can only mark the day of your periods.  There is no options for fertility monitoring where you can enter symptoms and ovulation.  There is also no option to enter calories in your app.  Coming from a fitbit I was very disappointed with this.  The bracelet even when on tight comes off of the leaf often.  In my opinion the leaf is too big to wear nicely as a necklace.  I was so sad.  This has such possibility and the company blew it.,Beautiful but so dissapointing.,2

2017-04-04,"Fun and useful product! I needed to invest in a new activity tracker when my Jawbone UP2 strap broke (which was a shame, because other than a poor strap, it was great!). Not wanting to make the same mistake, I came across the Bellabeat, and was totally sucked in by how pretty it is. Fortunately, it's also pretty functional. Super easy to set up, and great to have the option of wearing it on a necklace, bracelet or clip (although I sometimes find the clip less easy to use, and end up just popping it into my running shorts pocket instead). I've been impressed by how accurate the sleep tracker is, and hope that the activity tracker is similar (although I do have to keep remembering to set where I am wearing it, as it does make a difference).Just a couple of things that my old activity tracker did that I do miss:- buzz me when I hit my step goal (yes, immature, but somehow, rather satisfying!)- allow me to track what I eat in addition to all the other good stuff. One could argue that what one eats affects one's stress levels just as much if not more than some of the other indicators, and it would be interesting to watch that evolve over time (although I can imagine that it would be much more complicated to design).But these are minor things, and more than compensated by the cool meditation options that I probably would not have done without them being built in, and the ability to have a more holistic overview of how I am managing myself. Not to mention the compliments one receives by wearing something so cute!",Not just a pretty face,4

Something that is super useful for me is the battery life on the Leaf. The Leaf's battery life is suppose to last for up to 6 months. The one thing I hated about my Fitbit was forgetting to charge and not being able to track for that day.I love love love how sleek the device looks. It seriously work as a piece of fashion accessory. The only thing is I wouldn't recommend wearing the Leaf as a bracelet when you sleep because it is a little bulky. My con for the Leaf is the vibration feature.

2017-03-03,"I've been wearing the Leaf Urban for about six weeks now, generally every day, and so far I'm happy with it! I was initially drawn to it because I was looking for a tracker that would remind me to get up and move if I'd been sitting too long, and I appreciated the versatility of being able to wear it several different ways. And it's pretty!I actually like that there's no display on this--I can just clip it on and forget about it. If you're the kind of person who likes to check your step count throughout the day, the Leaf probably isn't for you--but if you're looking for a more realistic tracking of your actual habits, this is perfect.I don't use the sleep tracking all the time, but when I do it's very accurate. I also like the built in meditation and breathing sessions.The app could use a few more bells and whistles, but overall it's a win!",I like it!,4
2017-01-23,"I'm really enjoying using this health tracker, I get so many compliments and people are always surprised that a heath tracker can be so cute! I always refrained from getting fitbits bc I temd to dress on the nicer side but they didn't quite fit my aesthetic. The app is easy to use but there are features that I am still figuring out. The sleep tracker is on of my favorite things as I can see exactly how long Im sleeping for and if I'm getting good sleep. I have done a few of the programmed meditations and they seem to be very good however I have never meditated before so don't have a preconceived idea of how it should be. I love how diverse it is with it's many features PLUS different ways to style it. Mostly I wear it as a clip or bracelet. When using it as a clip it can be hard to fasten but I have seen this in a positive way since once I have it in place it is secure and does not seem like it is going to fly off or anything. Over all Im very happy with it and higky reccomend.",Very cute and diverse!!,4

Comparable to my Fitbit the # aren't exact but pretty close. So it will do. I just wish it had more feature tracking.As much as I want to love this thing, I can't. It is way off in steps accuracy by like double. I just got up and already it's reading I have 400 steps. I got excited when I first got it and it was tracking I've exceeding my step goals but when compare to my Fitbit and my husbands Fitbit it is way off. This will defeat the purpose of having it. It's hella cute though.",As much as I want to love this thing,3
2017-03-28,The device and app are easy to use. The strap that comes with it is not as user friendly. The latches disconnect very easily and as a result I've ordered a more sturdy & easier to use strap. I also thought it would do a better job tracking my yoga practice automatically. It does do a pretty good job with tracking my sleep.,"I like it, but it could use a few tweaks.",4

2017-01-14,"I've had my leaf urban for several days, and I like it a lot, but it has so easy issues. It was a very frustrating experience to set up because it wasn't communicating with my phone properly. The necklace chain it comes with is very nice, and doesn't pinch or get tangled in hair. The leaf itself is pretty, but a bit bulky. The bracelet band it comes with needs to be worn almost uncomfortably tight, or it will fall off because it is attached with a hood instead of something more secure like a lobster claw clasp.As for the functionality, I like my leaf, but I'm a little disappointed. The material I read before I bought was very vague on what the device actually did. It seems that the device itself is only a fancy pedometer of questionable accuracy. The app supposedly tracks activity, sleep, meditation goals, and menstrual cycle. The app has some really great built-in guided meditations, but most of the data the app collects is self-reported, like sleep and cycle information. The only information the device seems to collect is movement.I do like that the app tracks sleep goals, for example, I work nights and I rarely get to sleep for more than three hours at a time. The app allows me to set a daily goal for sleep, and tracks the daily cumulative time I have slept, which is nice. I also like that I can set meditation goals, but meditation has never been my primary means of stress relief, and I wish I could track other daily time goals like reading, or painting.The app also lets you report on activity, but the choices seem limited and sexist, and I was frustrated that I couldn't add my own types of activity. As someone who practices a few martial arts, I was disappointed that the closest thing that was represented on the list was vague and inaccurate  ""kickboxing"". I would have preferred a vague label like ""martial arts"" than one that implies a gym cardio kickboxing class that has nothing to do with a real martial art.The app also doesn't allow you to track your food and water intake, which I think would have been extremely useful for a ""fitness"" tracker.Altogether, the app and device are cool but lacking. I would really like more options to be added to the app and a heart rate monitor added to the device.","Pretty cool, but not what I was hoping for.",3

2017-05-18,"I am on day 4, wearing my BellaBeat Urban!!

I was going to call customer service today, after reading all THE Day's and trouble shooting...but this morning it seems to be tracking!!  So I am going to see how it goes!!I love wearing mine as a necklace, super cute!!Wearing it as a bracelet was a little uncomfy for me, the shape and flatness of the leaf felt hard and awkward on my wrist and I felt that the leather bracelet was too snug on my wrist.and I have pretty average wrists!!...but it's super pretty as a necklace!-heather",I love the style and the app,4
2017-03-29,"This tracker is absolutely beautiful, probably more than it is functional. I like that it reminds me when I need to stand up and be active based on my preferences. The biggest thing is downloading apps to sync to it so that it works better. It's incredibly accurate with tracking my sleep pattern and knows when I have a restless night. It takes in to account how much activity and sleep you've done to measure your ""stress"" levels. You have to manually input activities like running and yoga for it to know you've worked out. Overall it does what I need it to do and the app is very user friendly. For someone who is a health nut I think they should gear towards something else.",Pretty and easy to use,4
2017-04-12,"I'd been looking at fitness trackers for a while and saw the Leaf sometime last year.  I finally decided to take the plunge after a visit to my doctor and because I've been experiencing a lot of stress over the past few months.So far, so good. I like the reminders to get up and do something, whether it's an activity or to meditate.  It's easy to let those things slide during the day. Having those reminders and able to customize them makes taking on or letting go of behaviors much easier.  And the sleep tracking featureThe Leaf is very attractive and a very nice change from the more utilitarian designs you see in fitness trackers.  I like the necklace but will need to get a longer bracelet as I have larger wrists. This is not a deal breaker for me, however, and I'm looking forward to what else I can explore with the Leaf.",Works for me!,4

I am looking forward to growing with it and seeing the improvement with myself and daily activity.,... my leaf for a week now and I absolutely love it. It does everything I want it to ...,4
2017-03-29,"Pros: It doesn't look like an activity tracker, and it blends in with any outfit. The sleep tracker is on target, every time. The app is very user friendly, and syncing the Leaf to your phone is seamless. The meditation tracker is very helpful, and I find myself using it when I'm stressed or just need to wind down. Also, the customer support is AMAZING! They respond to questions quickly and are committed to you enjoying their product.Cons: I found the double wrap bracelet to be annoying and cumbersome; I couldn't seem to find the right fit without it being too tight or too loose. You have to manually input your workouts,  which seems silly for an activity tracker. The Leaf automatically calculates calories burned when you enter the workout. I question its accuracy of calories, as the automatic calculation doesn't take into account your actual movements during the workout.Overall, I would recommend this to those who are interested in a no-frills fitness tracker. Personally, I didn't need a HR monitor or phone notifications. It isn't waterproof, but that's fine, as I clip it to my shirt anyway. The company is relatively new and they're fine tuning a great product, so I'm comfortable with its flaws because the company is interested in user feedback and improving along the way.",Does the job and it looks good!,4

Chatted with C/S. Fixed. Very next morning synced it now it is not responding at all .Now on another Chat because leave is not responding AT ALL. Also needs a better clasp  for the band.

2017-04-11,The Bellabeat urban leaf is different then any other fitness tracker.  I get compliments on it and people are surprised I am wearing a fitness tracker.  That is the point I want to get to.  It looks like a piece of modern jewelry and it has a dual function as a tracker.  I love my piece.,Functional jewelry...wow!,4
2017-03-30,"Overall I like the Leaf Urban. It's great at tracking steps and sleep. It tracks these activities similar to the fitbit charge 2. The one thing that I miss from the fitbit that I wish was part of the leaf is message/meeting notifications. I would love for it to vibrate when I'm receiving a message or a meeting reminder. I like that I don't need to charge it like I had to do with my fitbit.However, I love that you can wear the leaf a variety of different ways. I prefer the bracelet. It doesn't fall off for me like I've read with other reviews. Although I can see how it's possible.","Like it, but could use some minor improvements.",4
2016-12-14,I really like wearing a tracker with style.  I wish I could link it with the WW app.,Four Stars,4
2017-11-02,"I really wanted to love this.  While I did really like the style and it's proposed ability to wear it in multiple ways; bracelet, necklace and clip, I found it just did not do a good job of keeping track of my steps or activity or sleep.  If I wore it as a bracelet it added too many steps, the necklace did not track well at all, and while the clip was somewhat more accurate it was difficult to clip onto my clothes.  I also found the bracelet to be very uncomfortable with having to wrap it around the wrist and then try and secure it.  It was very difficult and maybe the leather would have softened with wear, but a simple wrist strap would have been much easier to get on and off.  The app was not very user friendly and left much to be desired.  You had to constantly sync it to update and so you could not get a real time sense of where your activity level was.  It also did not give you the reminders it seem to claim to do.  Had to return it and will be looking for another tracker as my Fit bit broke.","Wanted to love it, but it wasn't meant to be",2
2017-03-24,"I have had my Leaf Urban for about a month now and am pleased with its performance. I was looking for something to keep me motivated to stay active and this does the trick. I especially like that you can set goals for amount of active time or step count. Plus, not having to plug it in to charge is great. I have noticed that the 3 different positions to wear it don't register steps the same way, so I tend to stick with the bracelet for everyday use. The only downside about the bracelet are the hooks. I like the look of the hooks, but would prefer if there was a hinged closer for a bit more security and ease in putting it on. I think the Nature version has lobster clasps instead of open hooks, so that strap may be more secure.",... Leaf Urban for about a month now and am pleased with its performance,4
2017-05-06,"I have had my Leaf Urban for about a week. Prior to that, I had a regular Fitbit, a Jawbone Up, and then a Charge HR. Both Fitbits only lasted about a year and I hated the Jawbone, so I decided to try something new. I liked the look of the Leaf so much more, and I really liked not having to charge it. So far I feel like it tracks my steps pretty accurately. I don't think it tracks my sleep as accurately as my Fitbit. I have had no issues with syncing, though I read there have been some.Pros: no charging; look - I get compliments on my bracelet, and people are surprised when I tell them what it actually is; ability to wear it 3 ways - love that I can clip it to my sports bra during heavy physical activity; guided meditation - meditation is something I have never done, so I need the guides; stress tracker; period trackerCons: I miss the heart rate monitoring and watch that my Charge had; I wish it integrated with myfitnesspal; I wish it synced automatically; when I add my actual exercise time, it subtracts my steps from my step total (???)Overall, I am enjoying it.Update: I still get compliments on my bracelet, but this device needs a lot of work. It does not track sleep accurately at all. I quit adding my daily elliptical workouts because it subtracts the steps that it added during the time I say I am on the elliptical. I am now using Google Fit to track my exercise. I will be likely be going back to a Fitbit when the battery on this needs to be replaced.Update: I have had this about 2 and a half months now, and the battery is dead.",Leaf Urban,2

It is easy to use, sync, and track your activity/sleep/cycle. My one complaint is that the bracelet doesn't fit me- it is too small wrapping it around my wrist twice and too long wrapping it around once, I would understand if my wrists were large but I would say they are normal.

One of the primary reasons I chose it is because of the meditation feature, which I have been using daily. I find that it's not so accurate about counting steps when worn as a necklace or clip on, but the bracelet options works well. If you're looking for a hardcore fitness tracker, this isn't for you. But if you're looking for an overall wellness tool and like the looks of this, I highly recommend it. One downside is that the clip on tends to get bent from stretching over bulky clothing, which lends to it falling off if you're not careful. It's also not waterproof, which makes it one more thing to think about when deciding where to place it during intense workouts.

When ""downloading"" the stats to the app via pushing the leaf twice, half the time that is ineffective and gives no results. I have not had this for very long, but I am not satisfied with the purchase, personally. It is pretty and goes with many outfits; however, the effectiveness of its actual purpose is low in my mind.

So basicaly it measures your steps and your sleepy times. Sadly I returned it after only a couple of days.",You can get the same on free apps.,2
2017-03-13,"Really bombed out for me. Now, it's true this is designed for women and part of its uniqueness is that ithelps keep track of your menstrual cycles, and I'm a man so that part was irrelevant for me. Besides, atmy age, even if I was a woman, I wouldn't be having those cycles anyway.What bombed out for me was the regular underlying functions which I expected to function MUCHBETTER than they did!! Fitness tracking: sucks, doesn't even get close to accurate on step counts,nor on flights of stairs climbed ! !SLEEP FUNCTION TOTALLY WORTHLESS!! I thought since it has a metal plate against your skin,that it would somehow detect my heart rate or breathing rate to accurately tell me how many hoursof sleep I got. WRONG, it expected me to tell it how many hours of sleep I got!!?? Say What??One day I went to bed at about 10:30 pm, got up about 9:30 am (yea, a lot of catching up sleep),and when I checked, it told me it thought I had slept from about 10:30 pm to the next evening at5:20 pm!! It thought I had slept over 18 hrs!! Apparently I wasn't moving around a lot that day(recovering from an injury) but still, that's ridiculous, I wasn't even in bed much less asleep that long.It wanted me to correct it, if it was wrong. Instead, since this wasn't the first time it screwed up ongetting sleep or steps right, I sent it back.I hope they work on this and get it right, I light the idea of a fitness/health tracker that doesn't haveto be recharged frequently, or screw up on the syncing function, but they have a LOOOONNNGGGway to go.",Basic sleep and step count functions do NOT work!!,1
2017-08-10,"Well . . my saga starts with the USPS who jammed the box so tight into my mailbox, I couldn't remove it, and neither could my athletic daughter. I had to leave it in overnight until the local post office could get someone out to get it out of my mailbox.First off, the bracelet is designed for thin people.  Given that it's a wrap style, there is no reason it could not be made longer.  They direct  you to PURCHASING a bigger one - I guess this is only designed for thin people right out of the box. I did contact the company and expressed my feelings on this matter, and they did offer to send me one at no cost. But I shouldn't have needed  to ask.Second, I had trouble pairing the device.  It kept failing, then when I tried again, I was told the device could not be found. Following the steps on their  site, I had to turn off and back on the phone, then suddenly it was paired and working, no additional steps necessary.  Still, should have been much smoother.  This is  with a S7 Edge.Third, I had to go online to figure out how to get it to show me my steps.  Instructions could be better through the app itself.Fourth,  While it showed me my initial steps.  After I had sat down for a few minutes, then got back up and walked around, it stopped showing me additional steps.  I have tried it again... .still nothing.Fifth, - When I contacted the company - forced to use email - NO OTHER CONTACT METHOD is provided - I received a response that it could take UP TO 72 HOURS or longer (because of  the weekend) for them to get back to me.This is entirely unacceptable customer service, especially when the only method of contact is by email, and the device can't  even be used for the purpose it was purchased for.STRONGLY considering returning the device and going with fitbit.",Device not working - 72 hours to wait to hear back on a problem is horrible customer service,1

2017-05-15,"I have faithfully worn my Leaf Urban for a month now. I saved my money and was thrilled when I could purchase mine. One month later, I'm returning it. I really, really wanted to like it, but the Leaf is not up to par as a fitness tracker.Pros:-The look is sleek, I've gotten a lot of compliments and questions about my Leaf.-It's lightweight and easy to wear.Cons:-The biggest detractor for me is the Leaf app is extremely limited in its capabilities. It tracks steps, sleep, and menstruation. I don't use the meditation portion, that's not something I feel the need to track.-The Leaf does not sync with other apps like My Fitness Pal. It links to Google Fit, which I then have to link to MFP. It's a pain, and a lot of info gets distorted in the shuffle.-The Leaf does not sync automatically.-The metal scratched within the first 2 days of wearing. The leather strap got dingy and discolored within 2 weeks.This product may be good for people who do not like the look of a fitness tracker, but it's very limited and inconvenient.

2018-03-15,"After about 6 months of use, my leaf will randomly stop tracking steps for a day or two (this has been happening for over 4 months now).  I've tried all of the things that their eager but unhelpful customer service folks have suggested (tightening screws, opening it up and moving metal pieces inside, etc.) which work for a little while and then it stops tracking again.  I really like many of the options on this fitness tracker, including the meditation app (although some of the recordings are a little weird) and the focus on promoting overall health; and the look is perfect. The different options for wearing the Leaf and the period tracking are great.  However all of that doesn't mean much when the Leaf won't function correctly on a consistent basis.  The company has an amazing idea, but hasn't been able to implement it very well. This whole process has been incredibly frustrating and customer service has been useless and a waste of time.

2017-02-10,"I've had my leaf just a few days.  Here are my initial thoughts on it.  I am wearing it as a necklace and have received so many compliments on it from both men and women- all were amazed that it was a health tracker.  The setup was very easy nice app although I wish the printing was in black ink, it's grey and for me being a bit older is hard to read.  On the negative side, this does not keep a step count, you have to add your walking and activities in manually.  In addition, I have seen other devices that ""nudge"" you if you are inactive for too long, I wish it had that feature as I work in an office and try to remind myself to get up and walk every hour.  I'm not convinced that the ""stress"" feature is really accurate, I'm not sure how it's configured to figure that out.  I was at 110% the other day (I know myself) when my app told me I was 40%. I am post menopausal so the period tracker, for me, isn't used.  I have until May to return, I'm going back to the drawing board to see what is out there and may consider returning it for something that has the missing features that I mentioned.","Beautiful Piece of Jewelry, A Little disappointed",3

2018-02-14,"Full on review.. I received this for valentines day.. I drooled over it.. but man in just 1 night have I lost massive sleep over it..  Below is honest reviews about each 'feature'.Fertility:The fertility monitor is prehistoric.. as far as women's health is concerned. It does not learn your body, Does not actually have any form of algorythm other then saying of 2 cycles.. your average is... which is based on information you enter.  It does not predict ovulation.. or ANY form of fertility.  The only way that it could is if it measured your BBT and without a themo its just not going to happen..(I will update this particular review in a few months)ExerciseI decided to approach this from a different view point, so you can get an open minded review. If your looking for a fitness tracker this isn’t for you.While it’s true it allows you to track what you do and how long you do it. This product will always fail in comparison to one with a heart rate monitor. Since it is a key element in fitness training.However it’s a good place to start to get an idea of where you are actually at in your everyday life.  Especially if your not the type to work out at a gym.  But still want to improve your overall health. Like if you have been particularly lazy during the week and decide to reve it up by walking down a few more isles grocery/clothes shopping.Vote: NeutralNo for fitness trainees, Yes to Supermoms and places you can’t wear braceletsMeditation*Okay so... What about mediation?  Well Tell you what hop on youtube, play a video and just mark the time on your calender.. it doesn't matter if you 'meditate' your score is the score length of the audio playing in the background.. in the background.. your 'goals' are tracked by audio.. not by your body's skin contact energy or breathing. -Gimmick (my views haven’t changed I was jogging and the “waves” mellowed out. Even though it was suppose to be a constant sync. - GimmickSleep Monitor? (Update)The sleep monitor appears to be learning however, if you “add a nap” because you sleep in 2-3 hour intervals you will bug your data..  and nothing will upload right if you sync it.  Also once you sync if you want actual data for any later naps, it will not add and analyze it.  Otherwise it does seem to be very accurateDon’t manually log anything there and sync once a day only.-GoodStress Monitor - *update*. While I still feel like this is heavily simulated because it is based off of data from the other topics and not “you” in the now.Say you have an argument with someone and then sync you won’t notice any change.. that day or the day after. It doesn’t appear to show the true effects mental stress can have on someone, which also affects their body and overall health.It does appear to measure what areas your lacking in the above categories, and base which of those categories will have the highest impact of stress.- NeutralStress is more then what is listed, and it’s deadly.  I guess while you can’t control everything knowing what you can control can be beneficial.This product is great for the busy body wanting to bring control back in their lives and get an idea of where they stand, but not so great for the athlete, or fitness user.",Gimmick or not?

2016-12-04,"I really wanted to love this tracker, but it was just not accurate for me.  I originally purchased the Leaf Nature.  It was beautiful and seemed to be working fine, until one day, a few weeks after purchasing, it wasn't.  I had a pedometer that I wore at the same time to make a comparison.  The Leaf was way off.  If it had been just a few hundred steps different, I would have thought that a reasonable margin of error, but it was off by thousands.  Bellabeat customer service did work with me on trying to find a solution, but none of the fixes they suggested improved the accuracy of the Leaf, so I ended up returning it.  I really liked the app and I really liked the way the company was very responsive to customer feedback, so I decided to give them another try, hoping that maybe the bad experience I had was just a fluke.  This time, I purchased the Leaf Urban and I liked it even better than the Nature.  It was beautiful and I did like that it was just a little bit smaller than the Nature.  I liked the graphite color and I didn't have any problems with the band when I wore it on my wrist.  Again, I wore the tracker and the pedometer at the same time and again, for the first few days, it seemed to be working ok.  There was a difference of a few hundred steps between the two devices, but I thought that was reasonable.  But it wasn't long before I started noticing that the Leaf seemed to be tracking less and less compared to the pedometer.  The tipping point for me was on Thanksgiving.  I had the Leaf clipped to my shirt all morning.  After running around the house all morning cleaning, cooking, prepping for the holiday, running up and down the stairs countless times, I checked my steps.  This was around noon time and the tracker had recorded zero steps.  Zero.  I was so disappointed.  I can accept it missing a few steps, but to not have recorded any steps at all after all that running around?  I just couldn't accept that.  By the end of the day it did record a few hundred steps so it's not as though it had stopped working completely.  But the pedometer had logged several thousand steps by comparison.  I just couldn't justify keeping it after that.  The next day, Black Friday, I went out and got a Fitbit instead.  It is ugly.  I hate the way it looks.  But, for the same money, it has a lot more features and is a lot more accurate.  When I bought the Leaf I didn't care about all the extra features, I loved the look of it and the fact that it was designed with women's health in mind, not just fitness, and I loved that the company seemed responsive to their customers.  But I really can't justify keeping it if it doesn't count the steps for me.  I wish I could be one of the many customers that it seems to work great for, but that just wasn't my experience.  It broke my heart to have to pack it up and ship it back, I really wanted it to work for me.","I wanted to love it, but it just didn't work out",3

2016-11-12,"Pretty disappointed with my purchase. I've been a Fitbit One user for the last 2 yrs tracking steps and sleep. The leaf does not compare in accuracy including the period tracker. For a week, I wore both Fitbit One and the Leaf to compare the steps and sleep. Depending on how you wear the Leaf, it's wildly different from the Fitbit.When I wore it as a bracelet, I had 2,000 more steps than the Fitbit. Seems understandable that it would most likely pick up hand movements as steps. I then wore it as a necklace. This time, it was about 2000 steps less than the Fitbit. You might ask perhaps it's the Fitbit that is inaccurate. I can resoundingly say Fitbit is very accurate from wearing it for the past 2 years. My steps don't vary from day to day as I have the same routine most weekdays.  It would be a variation of about 1000 steps day to day. But with the Leaf, it fluctuated greatly even though my day to day wasn't very different.As for sleep tracking, it didn't pick up when I was awake in the middle of the night while my Fitbit recognized it. Now, the Fitbit isn't that accurate when it comes to sleep tracking but it's a lot closer than the Leaf. The Leaf seems to think I slept a lot more than I really did and says I slept over 8 hrs straight without waking up when the Fitbit picks up most wakings or restlessness.  One feature that I do like about the Leaf is that you don't have to activate or turn off the sleep tracker when you go to sleep/wake like you have to with the Fitbit.The period tracker is very basic and isn't really accurate about fertile and ovulating days. You're better off getting a free app that solely focuses on this. I know because I've used a different period tracker and it gets my next period date pretty spot on as well as the fertile/ovulating days. The Leaf has (again) wildly different days when I compare it to my other app.Pros:Aesthetically pleasingVarious ways to wear itCons:-Steps very inaccurate whether you wear it as a bracelet or necklace or clip on-Period tracker pretty useless-Sleep tracker very inaccurate and bulky to wear to sleep-Clip on feature needs work -- it's so hard to get it to clip on to your shirt because the clip is really tight and you have to use your nails to force it open a bit. I almost broke a nail doing this-Bracelet feature is inconvenient and prone to malfunction. It's hard to wear and once you have it on, the bracelet gets unhooked from the device. I almost lost it twice in one day because of the malfunction.-no long term comparison tracking. It's just day to day, I think one week at most.Overall, if you just want a fun, pretty gadget and don't really care about accuracy, this is the device for you. By no means am I an avid exerciser or health nut but if I have a gadget to do something, I prefer it to be accurate. I'm disappointed that I spent ~$150 on something I'm not going to use. I'll probably end up giving it to my 14 year old niece.They really marketed the heck out of this basic, inaccurate device appealing to people's eye for design but it turned out to be pretty worthless. I'm not sure why it gets such good reviews on here...some see to have received it for free which I think is a skewed review.",Worthless device if you care about accuracy,1

The bracelet they include doesn't stay on, so I ordered a custom made bracelet to make it work.  OK, so I figured that was alright.  And then I put it on and actually got some compliments on it.  But once I started checking the tracker, it felt off...like I worked and walked and it said I only took 2500 steps.  After 2 weeks of this, I decided to also wear a Fitbit at the same time.  The Fitbit showed over 7,000 steps at the end of my work day and the Bella showed 1,751 steps.  My husband and I also took a 30 minute bike ride...his Fitbit tracked the 2 miles, and mine tracked nothing.Truly, don't buy this if you are seriously trying to track your steps and get healthier.

2017-07-28,The urban works very well! It does everything it says it will do! The bracelet doesnt stay attached so i wore the necklace. I had 1 week and i was wearing it all day today on the necklace and standing at the shoreline it just falls off the necklace and lands in the wave. I tried to get it back so hard.

2016-11-10,"So disappointed. I wore it one day as a necklace because I couldn't get the bracelet attached properly. The clasp on one side kept separating while I was adjusting the bracelet size. It was totally inaccurate in tracking my steps. I wore my FitBit on my wrist and the difference in step counting was more than 2000 steps. It was annoying to have to go onto the app and sync it to see my steps.The next day I figured out how to get the bracelet on, but found it rather bulky worn on the wrist. As a nurse, I wash my hands often throughout the day and thought it would be difficult to manage.I decided to return it and stay with my FitBit. I originally was drawn to the Leaf urban for its attractive design and appearance, but they need to do some work on the bracelet design, app and tracking accuracy. Also it doesn't sync with WeightWatcher's, which is important to me.I see FitBit has some new bracelet styles that are more fashionable looking.

2016-11-12,"I brought the urban leaf because I have wanted a fitness tracker, but really do not like how a Fitbit or the like look. I love the look of the Urban Leaf, but I'm a little disappointment.First, like another reviewer reported, the bracelet is not secure. I prefer to wear it as a bracelet, and it has fallen off several times because of the open loop hooks that attach it to leaf. I think I am going to have to buy a different band I've seen sold on sites like Etsy- so that I can continue to wear it as a bracelet.Secondly, the accuracy of the activity (steps/miles) is off. I made sure that the app was synced with where I positioned the leaf while working out- - and after running 6 mi on a treadmill- it only logged me doing around 4.3 mi.  This happens consistently. I wish there was a way to specifically input how long you ran/worked out with intensity and/or pace (like on my fitness pal)-Lastly, and not a deal breaker, the sleep tracker is just OK. At first it was way off- (reporting only 3 hours of sleep, when inknowningot more) but it seems to be a bit more accurate.I love the meditation feature- and being able to track female cycles.So, I like it- but it's. it with out its quirks. None of these things would cause me to return it because I wanted a tracker to just help me meet my goals of being active very day.

2016-12-12,"I really do love my Bellabeat Leaf Urban. It's sleek, chic, and svelte. I had a Garmin Vivosmart before but the display bit the dust making it pretty much useless. It was also bulky and unattractive. I am not the sporty type and while I always wore my Garmin, I hated how ugly it was.So, Bellabeat UrbanPros:BeautifulDiscreetStylishCan be worn many ways (bracelet, clip, necklace vertically or horizontally)Tracks steps, activity (including yoga and sex! Wohoo!), sleep, meditation, and menstruation, and it uses all this information to calculate your susceptibility to stressWater resistantApp includes several great meditation practicesI ran into the ocean and played for about 15 minutes about 2 days after getting my leaf. I was worried I'd wrecked it. I rinsed it with a bit of clean water and dried it off and it was fine. (I don't recommend doing this, but happy it worked out).If you have even the most basic of jewelry making skills you can easily make all kinds of really cool accessories to wear with your Leaf urban. I've made several bracelets (a beaded one, a silver chain one, and a black corded one), a couple of necklaces (black cord and another silver chain), and I'm planning on making a mala for it. Etsy has lots of options for Leaf accessories as well.No need to charge it.

I do miss the ""watch"" aspect of the GarminIf you are a woman of size (""fat"" is my descriptor of choice, but I know most people find that to be a negative term as opposed to a neutral descriptor), the bracelet it comes with does not fit, so you have to wear it as a clip or necklace, unless you make your own bracelet.If you meditate on your own, not using one of the ones provided within the app, there is no way to add it (unlike the activity, where you can add)Wishlist:Display on the itemWaterproof for swimmingBlack leather bracelet option for the zaftig amongst usAbility to add meditation time without having to do one of the provided ones.

2022-02-13,"I bought mine directly from bellabeat but as they do not allow reviews I am putting one up here.  I love bellabeat. The concept, the heart, the app, the designs, everything except the 1 year warranty.  I have purchased 2 and the exact same issue happened both times so I know it's not a fluke.Bellabeat works perfectly for 3 months to 1 year. At that year mark it starts not tracking sleep here and there, then sync starts failing, then Bluetooth connection starts failing. They work with you to trouble shoot for a couple months and you will get it working periodically.  Then it starts failing to the point where there is no come back and then they say to not use generic or Duracell batteries. That leaves Energizer.After months of spotty usage and even Energizer batteries not working they tell you it's been over a year (even if you started your complaint before the year mark), so they offer 50% off.I am so sad this did not work out because they are beautiful and sturdy.I'm going moving on to something else. Not sure what yet. Bye bellabeat.",Works perfect for 1 year,3
2017-01-12,"I wanted a Bellabeat mostly because it is pretty, but I also liked that it tracks your sleep and menstrual cycle. It had great reviews on Amazon, and last month the website had them on sale so my mom and I each purchased one.I wear it as a bracelet and it works well. I'm not sure if it's more accurate than my phone's step tracker (my mom says her phone logs more steps than her Bellabeat, but we also think our phones overcount steps), but we don't always have our phones on us so it is way more convenient for both of us.Pros/features:- activity logging with just about every possible activity you can think of (including shopping and snow shoveling)- activity tracker tracks steps, distance walked, and calories burned (including resting calories)- sleep tracking, which seems to be fairly accurate - I could be wrong but I think it actually ""learns"" because it's gotten more accurate for me over time- meditation/breathing exercises you can download- tracking your menstrual cycle (you can turn this off), including estimating your fertile days and ovulation - I haven't had it long enough yet to know how accurate this is- setting your own goals for activity, sleep, and meditation- estimating resistance to stress by averaging your lifestyle habits- you can wear it various ways, although so far I've only worn it as a bracelet (several reviews said this was the most accurate)- water resistant, but I take it off to shower- and of course, it's pretty - I've gotten several compliments on itCons/issues:- I had some problems getting it set up with my phone - I have an Android and when it failed to sync, it actually said several users with Android phones had reported difficulty, so it gave me some troubleshooting steps and that worked- Every time I sync it, it says to ""double tap"" my Leaf, but really I have to tap it continuously until it connects- As I said above, I don't know how its accuracy compares to Fitbit or even to a phone's fitness tracker. However, I use it mostly to compare my daily activity to previous days, so I care about that more than the actual number of steps it says I take- Sometimes it's tricky to put it on. Since it detaches from the strap, sometimes it falls off the strap when I'm trying to put it on.Suggestions for improvement:- I wish the software were compatible with Achievemint, an app that connects to fitness trackers and rewards you for meeting certain goals. I hope this will be added eventually since Bellabeat is fairly new- It would be nice if you could log and track your nutrition as well. I don't know if I'd use this myself, but I'm sure lots of people would.Overall I'm very satisfied with it! I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good fitness tracker.",Great little device!

2016-12-31,"I ordered my Leaf Urban directly from the company, and the delivery took about 5 weeks, which was stated on their website, so not a surprise.  I got the rose gold color, and I wear it primarily as a bracelet.  I get lots of compliments on it.  It's really a beautiful piece of jewelry, and I love the way it looks.  The Urban came with a chain to wear it as a necklace as well, which I have done a couple of times.  I don't think the readings are as accurate when it's worn on the chain.  I haven't worn it as a clip yet, so I can't comment on the security of the clip staying on clothing, but I have tucked it inside the waistband pocket on my workout pants, and it is accurate when worn that way.  I haven't put the water resistance to much of a test yet, but it has gotten splashed a couple of times with no problem.  People are usually very surprised if I tell them it's a fitness tracker, and I like that.  I like the look of the app, and it's very easy to use.  I also like the readily available meditations.

I've become completely addicted to mine. I wear it 24/7 except for in the shower. If I haven't reached 10,000 steps, I walk at night or run my stairs until I do. I realized that even with 1 HIIT class per day- if I sit the rest of the day working, I might not actually hit my 10k!! It makes me wonder how few steps a day desk-jobbers get. I also love the period tracking!! And the sleep! Oh my! I see just how often I wake up, so I'm working to better that.Their customer service is great.

2016-11-18,"The universe has finally provided a fitness tracker designed by women for women! The Bellabeat Leaf is truly amazing!Some of its greatest features are versatility and no-mess technology! You can wear Bellabeat as a necklace, bracelet, or clipped on as a pendant, so it always matches your outfit. I've received so many compliments no matter how I wear it.And it really is no-mess technology, too... Bellabeat Leaf does not have to be charged! It uses a standard watch battery, which can easily be changed when needed (only twice a year!).Bellabeat Leaf tracks exactly what I want and none of what I don't. You can track your activity in diffferent ways to suit your needs: a step counter or a general activity monitor. It will vibrate to alert you to inactivity (and you decide how often that is), and it has a different vibrating pattern for any alarms you want to set (wake up, medicine, etc...).Bellabeat also tracks your sleep! It's very accurate and will sense if you get up in the middle of the night. But the two features that are most unusual are Cycle Tracking and Meditation Tracking.Bellabeat Leaf tracks your cycle by data input. You set the initial parameters and the Leaf does the rest! It can track menstruation, fertility, and ovulation!The Meditation Tracking is truly a unique feature of the Bellabeat Leaf. In the mobile app used to sync your device, Bellabeat provides about 15-20 different guided meditations. During your session, the Leaf tracks your success by monitoring movement and breath during the session. It is an innovative feature that is essential to its overall goal, which is tracking your stress levels.That's right. We're not done yet. The Bellabeat Leaf's ultimate goal is to keep track of your stress level and encourage you into a lower-stress lifestyle. It accomplishes this by using an algorithm based on your activity, sleep, menstrual cycle, and meditation habits. It can then let you know how vulnerable you are to stressers in your life and recommend something to help combat it.This fitness tracker really packs a punch!","So many features, such a beautiful design!",5
2016-12-08,"I love my Bellabeat Leaf Urban - Rose color.  I've had mine for a little over a month and where it 99.9% of the time. Only time I don't is if I'm going swimming or taking a bath. I love how it can sense the way I sleep. On several nights - I've had rough nights of sleep - it even senses those (as long as you don't forget to keep it on your person. ) I love the period tracker. I usually in the past have used an app on my phone to keep track of my period. (Which I still have as a back up), but it's nice to have it all in one location. Yes, I have to manually enter when my cycle has started/ended - but since I did that on the app on my phone it's not a big deal. I really like the mediation part of the Bellabeat.  I've taken advantage of it several times, ironically I have a better night's sleep after I remember to do those....I never really believed there was a connection to that kind of thing before. I'm a Curvy girl, so the bracelet didn't fit my wrist, so I've been keeping it clipped on to my pants pocket or on my shirt since I've gotten it. I did find a bracelet that is made for the Bellabeat on Etsy that I can't wait for it to arrive - so that I can wear the Bellabeat in all 3 fashions, not just the 2 I'm currently wearing it. The ONLY negative I have for the Bellabeat is that the bracelet that it comes with is made of hooks to attach the Bellabeat to. I personally don't feel it's very securely attached that way, the bracelet that I ordered on an Etsy store has better clasps for the Bellabeat to be attached with.  So I can't wait for that.",Loving the Bellabeat!,5
2016-11-18,"I love my leaf urban! There are so many different ways to wear this thing, as a bracelet (my favorite), a necklace, or clipped to the waistband of your pants or your shirt; so no matter what I've got going on I can wear my leaf without worrying it clashes with an outfit. The sleep tracker has been particularly helpful, in addition to the meditation programs, alarms, and cycle tracker this device is so much more than a fitness/step counter. The app allows me to add activities to my days and has a huge variety of them to pick from, and the alarms I have set remind me to get up and move around if I've been sitting for too long. There are several different settings in the app you can adjust to customize your leaf experience.

2016-11-15,"I've only had my Urban for a week or so, and sadly haven't yet had a chance to go jogging with it (the main reason for the purchase).  However I have immensely enjoyed tracking my movement and sleep.  There isn't a single thing that I've done with it that I haven't liked.  It's a gorgeous bracelet, an amazing clip, and a dazzling necklace.  It tracks my sleep like I didn't believe it could (I had attempted this with other fitness trackers and had trouble getting comfortable with them but with this one as a clip, I don't even notice it).  I've never been one for meditation so I haven't tried that feature as of yet, though the stress tracking hints that perhaps I should try it.My only complaint is the cycle tracking- it does little more than show when to expect my cycle and since I'm not the most regular...  The Clue app has truly spoiled me with how much information I can put in and it offers in reminders as I approach my cycle and I can update as my cycles change.",However I have immensely enjoyed tracking my movement and sleep,5
2016-12-31,"Have been using my urban leaf for about two months now (as a bracelet) and have to say I thoroughly enjoy it. This is my first tracker and find it encourages me to be more active and increases my general health awareness.The app has several useful features-my favorite is individually tracking assorted activities for my total fitness goals. While it might be nice to see feedback on the leaf itself, that would take away from the beauty of my leaf.... and the look is perfect.  Fortunately my memory is still good enough to remember how long I worked out when I get back to my phone and sync🙂 I have been meditating to a mantra for about two years and find it interesting, while quirky, how the app calculates your stress levels based on your activity, sleep, and meditation.  Initially it was frustrating to go through the guided scripts if I wanted ""credit"" for my daily meditations. Happily the app has been updated, with an option to manually record mantra meditations.The sleep monitoring is also curious. It definitely picks up when I wake during the night ...sometimes a lag in recording -turned over and went back to sleep. As long as it allows a manual adjustment of my sleep time, that works for me.I very much appreciate being able to wear it 24/7- to sleep -in the shower -all day (although the leather bracelet is showing signs of wear already).  The bracelet took some squirreling around to get tight enough, now if I need to take it off, just unhinge at the clip loop.Having been post menopausal for several years, I have not explored the period tracker.  Perhaps at some point BellaBeat development will look at hormonal cycles across the lifespan.  It's likely that has a stress component as well.In summary this is been the perfect way to get me moving and aware of my couch potato ways. Had shunned other trackers because they look like security monitors prisoners wear..... my leaf can go anywhere I do.If you're a super fitness buff this may not be technologically your best choice, as a woman with way too much to do this keeps me on as much track as I can handle🙃.",Got a new LEAF (urban) on Life,5
2017-03-31,"I have only had this tracker for about a week now but I really love it-for the most part.Shipping was super fast to Canada which is awesome.I love the look of it but do feel the bracelet could be more secure as it has come undone from the bracelet ends, possibly lobster clasps for added security.  I have a large wrist and the large bracelet fits well.  I have worn it on my pants as well but it seems to fall off as well.The wake up alarm is not strong enough to wake me in the morning and the regular alarm is better but still feel it could be stronger-just a personal opinion.Syncing is a breeze and I like the mediation options as well.  Sleep tracking is a hair bit off and it doesn't tack naps but I edit it to add them in:-)Overall, I really like it, just could use some minor improvements.","Fantastic tracker, looks like jewelery!",5
2016-11-18,"I have have been using my Leaf Urban for about a month now, and I love it! One of the big sells for me on the Leaf is that it tracks stress. I've been dealing with a stress related issue for about six months and being able to see how my life style choices affect my stress level has been helpful. It's also super stylish which is great. People are always asking me what it is, and when I tell them about it they always think it's really cool.I love all the features on here. That's it's water resistant, has built in meditations to do (which is another REALLY helpful thing for me), and thatnit even can be set to vibrate to remind you to move more.I haven't had any troubles with my Leaf and would totally recommend it!",Love my Leaf,5
2016-12-15,"I purchased my urban leaf directly from the manufactured about two months ago. I did have to wait about 4 weeks to receive it but it was well worth the wait. This is my first fitness tracker and I must say that I am very pleased. I love that it does not look like a typical tracker and I get lots of compliments on it. I thought it would be bulky but it is not that bad, though I did have to get used to wearing it since I do not generally wear bracelets or watches. I wear mine constantly as a bracelet and if I put it on tight enough it will not fall off, it is showing a bit of wear but that is to be expected since I wear it 24/7. I purchased the silver/grey with the beige strap and an happy that it blends in nicely with my skin tone and my wardrobe. I love that it sends a gentle reminder if I've been sitting too long. The sleep tracker is pretty cool, although not always accurate- it does give you an option to adjust the times when you sync it first thing in the AM.  The cycle tracker is pretty neat and will come in handy if and when I decide to have a baby. I saw an app for pregnancy that links with the BellaBeat- which I think is pretty cool! I enjoy the meditation function as well, although I do not use it as much as a should.  Mainly I use this to track my steps and maybe sure I move enough during the day. It has definitely been a big motivator for me and well worth the investment.",Not Your Typical Health Tracker,5
2018-09-11,I kinda wanted a fitbit. I knew that I didn't want an ugly black band. When I saw the cool Bellabeat I waited for a while. When I finally bought it for myself I was amazed how much I liked it. It makes being active fun as I try to hit my goal every day. I also love how it keeps track of my sleep! It came with a ruber band (I wasn't sure if it came with anything when I bought it) I was also worried about the band fitting around my wrist as I'm a curvasious lady but it did just fine. I wish I bought it sooner!,Why did I wait so long to buy one?,5
2017-01-01,"I love my new Bellabeat urban leaf edition. It has helped me learn the importance of maintaining wellness in my mind, body and spirit. I believe this sets the Bellabeat apart from other comparable brands that keep track of only exercise, calories burned, etc. I love how my Bellabeat keeps track of not only my physical activity and sleep, but also my time spent in mindfulness, as well as all the details my menstrual cycles (fertility window, ovulation, etc). My favorite feature of the Bellabeat is that it takes all of those elements into consideration and then gives me a percentage of how susceptible I will be to stress on that particular day. The percentage has always been very on-point for me. This feature has been particularly helpful on days when I know I'm going into a long day at work--when I have known my stress susceptibility in advance, I have been able to be more mindful about taking minutes for self-care, which optimizes my productivity overall. In summary, my Bellabeat has helped me become more considerate and understanding of my personal holistic wellness. And the cherry on top of everything is that it is a beautiful piece of jewelry that I get compliments on all the time!",Excellent Holistic Care,5
2016-12-30,"After using three different types of Fitbit device over the last few years, the Lead Urban came as a revelation!Firstly, the accuracy is great - I knit and other trackers (wrist based) would count steps while I was sitting still, knitting. Also, I'd sometimes be driving and steps would rack up. Not so with the Leaf. I wear it as a necklace by day, and clipped onto my clothes at night or when exercising and the steps are much more accurate (and conservative - there's no cheating!!!).Secondly, I love that it doesn't need to be charged. Or regularly synced before the battery runs out. I've had it for a few months now and the original battery is still going strong. (Replacements are very cheap and I ordered a few from amazon to have them ready.)Lastly, I'm delighted with how it looks. I chose the grey/silver and it goes with everything and gets lots of compliments. It's versatile and so easy to wear.My only criticism is that the wristband is fiddly and too small for my wrists, although I didn't want to wear it on my wrist (I have an Apple Watch so don't want a wrist based tracker) I'd like the option. Having spoken to Bellabeat, I understand that larger wrist straps are in production.On that note I've also been really impressed with Bellabeat. They are open to feedback and listen to what customers want for the development. In the last few months there have been various software improvements and there are more to come. I'm excited to be a relatively early adopter of this brand.","Looks great, works great and no need to charge!",5
2017-01-05,Absolutely love my Bellabeat Leaf Urban! It's hypoallergenic  which I definitely need due to skin sensitivities that include various plastics (I tried another brand of tracker and couldn't wear it because of the materials in the wrist band). I find it very easy to use and wear and it's a beautiful piece too. I think that the focus of what is tracked is much more in tune with my lifestyle and what is important to me. I've been trying out the various meditations available on the app and have found them very helpful and enjoyable. I have a reminder set for medication as well as one for lack of activity  after an hour. It's nice to have a reminder to get up and move and brings my focus back to what is good for me. I know this is going to make a real difference for me. Hello 2017!,Love it!,5
2016-11-21,"I purchased my Leaf Urban through the Bellabeat website, and have had it since October. Although shipping took twice as long as originally anticipated, I am happy with the device now that I have had it for a few weeks. It's really easy to use, and I like the flexibility of the wearing options. In addition, I love that it looks like jewelry rather than a run-of-the-mill fitness tracker. The simple jewelry look and wearing flexibility is perfect to wear both in professional work settings, including walking to public transit to and from work, and causal times.  Also, I can switch up how I wear it to accommodate how I wear my work-out iPod and other accessories for various fitness activities.",Fitness tracking flexibility for professional and causal settings,5
2016-11-16,"I originally bought a Bellabeat Leaf Nature in October 2015 and have used it for the past year and loved it. Now that Bellabeat came out with the Leaf Urban, I was extremely excited to try it. This time I chose the Rose Gold version.The first thing I noticed that the bracelet seemed to be more durable than the one that came with my Leaf Nature. The leather on the bracelet for the Urban seems to be more ""finished"" than the one for the Leaf Nature, which wore out (started cracking and peeling and then wore through altogether) quickly with daily wear and needed to be replaced halfway through the first year of use (thankfully, Bellabeat replaced it for me at no cost when it did break - that's how good their customer service is!). The only negative thing about the Urban bracelet is how it attaches and detaches - it can come undone during activity (which it has for me several times) and could result in your Leaf Urban going flying. I tend to check my bracelet every so often and readjust as necessary. This is my favorite way of wearing the Leaf Urban because it gives the activity tracker the highest level of accuracy. I also like wearing it as a broach - it blends in with my outfits very nicely. I always get compliments on my Leaf Nature and Leaf Urban - they are truly beautiful to behold and meet the billing of ""smart jewelry.""Next, another thing that I liked was that when I went to sync the Leaf Urban with the Bellabeat app, it simply added the Leaf Urban as an additional Leaf, allowing me to choose to sync the Urban or Nature. They identified them with names of flowers (Daisy and Tulip). This allows me to accessorize with either Leaf and sync whichever one I'm wearing that day - very handy! I also love how the Leaf Urban is water resistant - I always worried if my Leaf Nature was splashed with water while I washed my hands, but not anymore when I wear the Leaf Urban.The Bellabeat Leaf app is very straightforward and easy to use and Bellabeat is constantly improving it based on feedback - they've added a wide variety of custom activities to choose from - which helps me calculate exactly how many calories I have burned each day because I can enter my Zumba workouts. I find that the sleep tracking feature has been spot on - but I do have to manually enter naps. This feature has been very helpful in letting me know exactly how much I sleep and how soundly. The period tracking portion of the app is helpful in keeping track of your cycle - I haven't found the ovulation estimator to be accurate, however. The stress tracking feature compiles your data such as your average activity, sleep duration, meditation, and where you are in your cycle to determine your stress assessment - I don't really look at this much because, while all these factors do contribute to stress levels, they aren't the only things determining stress, either. I don't really use the meditation feature, but I am sure that the exercises are of high quality for those who do meditate  on a regular basis.Overall, I would highly recommend the Leaf Urban for anyone who would like an activity tracker that disguises itself as a beautiful piece of jewelry. It is very versatile and it is something you will use everyday, without fail to help you improve your health.",Beautiful piece of Smart Jewelry,5
2016-12-28,"Love my leaf (mine is rose gold and goes with everything). I've had it for a couple of months and am enjoying the fact that I don't ever have to charge it, which seems a small thing, but I had a Fitbit and would have to change it about once a week and then forget it on the charger, etc... (my Fitbit also had been replaced a couple of times due to charging issues)I get lots of compliments on my 'bracelet' which is the primary way I wear it. I would wear it as a bracelet even if it wasn't a fitness tracker because it's so pretty! I do use the clip function when I run and sleep. Haven't really used the necklace much.I've also enjoyed that I can set an vibrating alarm to remind me to get up and move when I've been sitting at my desk too long!",Love it!,5
2016-12-28,"I've had my leaf for about a month now and have enjoyed wearing it every day. I primarily wear it as a bracelet or clipped my shirt. I wear the bracelet fairly tight and haven't had any issues with the band coming loose. I wish that it would be a little easier to clip on but it is very secure on my clothes. I can understand what other reviews complaints with accuracy. I have noticed a difference in steps between wearing the leaf on my wrist and wearing it in my shirt /as a necklace. However, I am a crocheter, so my steps always show higher when in the wrist. I also have worn a Samsung Gear S for two years and the leaf seems to be fairly similar in steps when worn on the wrist.I do love the look of it though. I've gotten many compliments and people love the thought that a fitness tracker could be pretty and feminine.",Love it!,5
2017-01-20,"I wanted this Bellabeat Leaf Urban sooooo badly for months!  I can't stand that all the smart watches and fit stuff is all wrist wear only, I can't stand bracelets! This can let me pick multiple ways to wear the accessory AND it looks really clean and classy regardless what outfit I wear. It has helped me focus more on self care, the meditations help my mind and anxiety calm down, and I am learning more and more about myself and my needs! I can't wait to see what more they add to the app! Maybe a food tracker or more syncing with other apps?  I wish I could go swimming with it personally, but otherwise this little smart accessory is perfect to me!  Thank you Bellabeat! I look forward to more!!!",Helping me turn my life around!,5
2016-12-20,"I had two FitBits that worked for about a year each then died. Plus, FitBits are ugly as all get out. I didn't have anything and came across the Bellabeat and decided to buy it. I absolutely love it! The fact that it can be worn clipped to clothing, as a bracelet, or as a necklace AND is attractive is what sold me on it. It tracks directly to my Android phone, and I receive a weekly recap of my data so I can see the daily average for the prior 7 days. I've contacted customer service once with a question and they responded quickly. For the price, I find it better than FitBit.",Nice Tracker,5
2017-01-06,"I kept seeing ads for the Leaf on my Pinterest feed, and one day my curiosity got the best of me and I clicked on the ad. I was immediately intrigued. After a lot of research and deliberation I decided to purchase the Leaf Urban. I've had it for two months and have been tremendously pleased with it! For me, the step count is pretty accurate, as is the sleep tracking. I normally sleep pretty well, but last week I had one restless night, and it pinpointed exactly when I was awake. I like having a little reminder throughout the day to move more when I've been still for too long, too. I have used several of the meditations, and found them to be pretty beneficial. I practice yoga every day and am able to input that manually into my activities very easily. The only feature I can't speak to is the menstrual cycle tracking as it is not applicable for me. I really love the look of it. It's so much prettier than other fitness trackers while still being totally practical. I wear it as a bracelet and I get lots of compliments and questions about it on a daily basis. I truly have no complaints about the Leaf. It's been a really nice, fun tool to track my daily activity. I highly recommend it!",I've had it for two months and have been tremendously pleased with it!,5
2017-03-10,"This modern little health tracker truly stands above the rest. Not only is it capable of doing what other smart trackers are, but it does so with style and pizzazz! This little device works alongside a user-friendly app with a clean interface to track your sleep patterns, menstrual cycles/fertility as well as your stress levels. You're able to input individual activities and length of time to add to the data and the app even has meditation tracks on hand to help you relax in different situations. Having the accessories included just add to the perks! ^^ Can't really go wrong with this deal of a tracker!",Fashionably Fit,5
2017-01-23,"I love my Leaf Urban that I received as a Christmas gift!  Unlike other health trackers, it is something classy enough to wear anywhere with style!  It does a better job of tracking my sleep than my Fitbit had and I absolutely love the meditations that you can do straight from the app.  They have been a life saver some days! Another perk is the vibrating alarm I use to remind me that it's time to take certain meds I usually forget mid-day.  The only thing I hope they add in a later update is for a notification on your phone for why it just vibrated.  There have been a few times that I was unsure what it was for!  Otherwise I absolutely love it and have received many compliments!",Stylish and Accurate Health Tracker for Women,5
2017-01-12,"I want to preface this by saying I'm not an avid runner (or person who CrossFit's or anything similar) but rather just a regular mom who wanted to be more mindful of their activity, sleep, etc. I didn't like the way the other fitness trackers worked or looked and really fell in love with the Bellabeat.  I like the Urban leaf because it was water resistant and slightly smaller.  I've had no problem with it syncing with my phone and my step counts and activity seem to be pretty accurate. I will say that I did not like the wristband that came with it which is too bad because that's really how I wanted to wear it.  I bought a couple of other bands on Etsy to try out and we'll see if that makes it better. I usually wear it clipped to my camisole and it has never been an issue. I'm really hoping that this will eventually sink with some of the other health apps on my iPhone then this would be really helpful. Overall I have really loved using the Bellabeat Urban Leaf!",Great and easy to use!,5
2017-04-13,"I had been eyeing the Leaf Urban for several months before I received it as a gift for Christmas. I've always wanted a fitness tracker to help keep me honest and motivated, but I just couldn't justify getting a FitBit because I knew, deep down, that I would never wear it. I've never gotten as many compliments on a piece of jewelry as I have with the Leaf Urban. It's delicate, beautiful, and goes with everything. When I tell people everything it does, they're doubly impressed and it makes me feel cool as a result. Which is a huge win.The meditation function is spectacular and completely unique. I'm terrible at remembering to slow down and get centered, and having the leaf turns my mindfulness work into a tangible goal. The fitness tracker is also incredibly motivating, and I love that I can enter in specific activities to get a clear picture of what I've done during a given day. Being able to get a visual picture of my potential stress level based on factors like sleep, length of meditation time and where in your cycle you are is super helpful for me, too. I don't know if it's placebo effect, but when my stress percentage is low on my app I feel much less frazzled by work.The only thing I struggled to get used to was sleeping with the leaf on. I can't even fall asleep with a hair tie around my wrist, but it was an adjustment worth making because I like knowing the duration and quality of my sleep.I saw some other reviews expressing some frustration with the bracelet function of the leaf, but I haven't yet experienced any issues on that front!All in all, I highly recommend this health tracker, especially if you're someone who wants the benefits of a fitness tracker without sacrificing style.","Simple, elegant, and user-friendly.",5
2017-01-12,"I really love my leaf, it has inspired me to be more calm. I have always been a bit of a stress-head, so now whenever begin to feel tetchy I have a nosy in at the app. At the very least this reminds me that I should take some time out or get some exercise. I really enjoy the guided meditation sessions. Most of the ones I have come across before took more time than I realistically had available to me when I most needed them. But Bellabeat offers sessions of varying lengths with some of the shorter ones being just 2 minutes long! That's short enough to do at work!My main reason for buying the Leaf was to inspire me to be more active, and slowly I am making the effort and watching my daily steps go up. The (what I like to call) lazy alerts are great, I know I've had a good day when I haven't felt it go off. One downside is that I don't think the pedometer is very accurate, but I suppose that could, in a way, encourage you to be more active to reach your daily step goal!I wear the Leaf on my wrist nearly all of the time as I've heard that it is supposed to give more accurate steps (and it looks really pretty!). It does count more than if I wore it around my neck or on my shirt. But I have taken long walks which I was sure would put me over my daily target and to my surprise I still haven't met my 10,000 step target! Hopefully spring will be here soon and I will be happier to venture out more often!I like that the app has additional activities which you can add, so if you're like me and you never meet your step target - you can add in your other activities so you don't feel disheartened!The sleep monitor has helped me keep a eye on my rest. I'm a night owl and often get less than 5 hours sleep, which is fine for some but I really need a full 7/8 hours to be feeling as fresh as I can, so if I haven't been getting that for a few days, I'll make sure I go to bed a bit earlier.And last but not least the period tracker just really helps put my mind at ease (my periods can be a bit sporadic with no tell tale signs). I personally am not sure how accurate any ovulation tracker can be as surely every woman is different, and wouldn't hormone levels need to tested? From past pregnancies it seems to me that I must ovulate earlier in my cycle than the time estimated in the app (and other apps I have tried) and I haven't found a way to adjust this. For now this doesn't bother me, but I look forward to a time where I may have more need for this feature and a chance to put it to the test!",Keeping my mind in tact and my legs moving,5
2017-01-02,I have been wearing my Bellabeat for almost 1 week now and love it. I wear it as a bracelet for the most part and it is stylish and comfortable. When I clip it on my bra to workout I forget I have it on. I do feel it keeps track of my steps and moves. It has kept track of my sleep very well also. I have used the meditation and really like it. I don't normally meditate so this is new for me. I have even fallen asleep to it.I had a little trouble setting it up with my phone (Samsung Galaxy 7) but I just had to keep at it and now all is working well. This was not a big enough issue to give it a lower rating.,Love my bellabeat!,5
2016-11-17,"I love my leaf! I used to have a fit but and too many time I accidently washed it and after replacing it a second time and yet again killing it I looked for something different. I love that it is a necklace. I get so many compliments on how it looks. A couple people have recognized it but it's fun to watch the look of amazement on people's face when I tell them what it is. I am also highly allergic to metal and have had no issues with this product. I wear it pretty much 24 hours a day as a Necklace and it does not bother me in the least. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something ""different"" than what everyone else has. The app is very easy to read and comperable to their competition.","Love my new necklace, um, I mean fitness tracker.",5
2017-01-01,"I received my leaf Urban the beginning of November and overall I really like the product.  It is well made, aesthetically appealing (not a plastic looking bracelet like FitBit), and the app is very user friendly.  I am not looking to start a family, yet I use the period tracking function to monitor my cycle.  The sleep function does a fairly accurate job of recording my sleeping times and quality of sleep.The main reason I purchased the Leaf Urban was to track my activity and when I am more active it accurately counts my steps.  However, it is not great at recording small walking sessions (like a quick trip to the ladies room, or the printer, etc).  I only wear it as a clip on my shirt or bra (I am waiting for a larger sized bracelet to come out to wear on my wrist), so that could have a slight impact on activity tracking. It does have activity reminders which is helpful if I've been sat at my desk for too long. Also, the Leaf Urban is more water resistant than the Leaf Nature, so I do not need to worry about getting it wet.The app has a large variety of activities that you can track and it will give an approximate calorie burn based on your height/weight.  The app also has amazing meditation sessions which are very useful if I am particularly stressed, anxious, or need help sleeping.If you are in the market for a device to track your movements, stress, periods, sleep; then I highly recommend the bellabeat. The best part is that you can hide your tracker on your bra and no one needs to know you are wearing it (although it is pretty, so you will want to show it off!).","Stylish, effective health tracker",5
2017-01-15,"Perfect for those of us who don't like the FitBit look and want to incorporate a meditation function into our days! I like the reminder to balance movement, sleep, and meditation, as well as the option to ""okay"" the info it presents about sleep or adjust it manually. It needs to be fastened fairly close to avoid having the bracelet pop off, and I find it difficult to clip onto fabric, so I usually wear as necklace on a longer chain than it came with; it's a lovely piece that keeps me mindful of balance!",Perfect for balancing life!,5
2016-12-20,"I've had the Fitbit before (and loved it), however, I didn't like the lack of options in how to wear it, like the Leaf Urban provides (clip, bracelet, necklace). I received my Leaf in 5 days and was so excited to use it. I really like how it monitors my daily steps and sleep, and I especially like the motivational tips. :) I found the bracelet difficult to put on, so have opted to primarily clip the unit on my shirt or wear it as a necklace. I have since misplaced my necklace and am looking to buy a replacement (am having a hard time finding it online, however). The Leaf Urban is a great, functional health and wellness product, and is so pretty too!",Pretty and functional,5
2017-01-23,"I love my Bellabeat Leaf. I wasn't sure if I was going to be happy with the Rose Gold since I don't wear much gold, and I mostly wear silver, but it looks great! The step tracker is very accurate and much better than my FitBit. I also love the meditation feature, and the fact that I can wear it as a bracelet, necklace, or even clip it on. I get asked all the time, when I'm wearing the Leaf as a bracelet, ""What is that?"". It is super cute/stylish and not just blah/bulky like every other step tracker out there.  I would definitely recommend this!",The Best,5
2016-12-27,"Love this product!It's seriously helped me to regulate my sleeping habits. I'm already very into fitness, and have a job that keeps me quite active, but the other features help me in so many ways! I'm so much more aware of how much sleep I get, so that helps me to prioritize going to bed early, and regulating how late I sleep (I also using LOVE the vibrate feature as an alarm in the morning, so I can wake up before my jarring ringer alarm goes off!) Once in a while it can be a bit off in terms of knowing when I fell asleep and when I woke up, but it's rare.I also love the menstruation tracking (also makes me so much more aware of where my body's system is during the month), as well as the stress/meditation tracker. I'm not comfortable with new age ""meditation"", so I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that there's a prayer tracker as an alternative!The only things I would change would be that the device be a bit thinner, and more options for a secure way to wear it. I have to wear the bracelet tightly, so it doesn't unhook, and I replaced the necklace it came with for one of my own that it a bit stronger. The clip on feature is VERY secure, however I have a tendency to forget to take it of my clothes when changing into my day clothes or pjs.Overall, I love this product though","Even though I'm already very into fitness, this has changed the way I take care of myself",5
2022-02-05,"I waited about 7 months before writing this review.  If the Bellabeat was cheaper it would be fine but for $100 I expect it to work longer than 6 months.  I have bought a few decorative activity trackers, I love my watch so don’t need my tracker to be one, and I think because of the cost this is the most disappointing.  The look is great and I do get compliments but if the tracker doesn’t work what’s the point.  It constantly doesn’t synch to my phone and I have to unscrew the device and wiggle the battery to make it synchronize again.  I have gone through 4 batteries in 7 months and I’m not even sure if they were dead.  I changed the battery two days ago and it stopped synching again already.  The battery tracker counts down to about 83% then stops.  It never actually shows the battery is dead. The sleep tracker is way off but I really have it for the steps.  They are a bit off compared to Apple but it’s not a huge difference.  It doesn’t really matter though since the tracker has so many issues synching and the only fix is to change the battery.  Then I lose all the data.  The customer service took a week to get back to me and told me just to change the battery.  If the tracker was cheaper I would be ok with all the glitches since you get what you pay for but for $100 I expect higher quality.",Too expensive to be so glitchy,2
2017-01-12,"Really enjoying my new Bellabeat Urban.  I love that it has a bunch of ways to wear it, and it looks nice on (no plastic bracelet, if I am wearing a watch I can wear my tracker on my clothes or as a necklace, and it doesnt have to show unless i want it to!) They have awesome customer service too.  Twice I needed to.chat with them and they were great, super helpful and when my problem was that the bracelet didnt fit my (man sized) wrists, they sent me a new larger one for free! I did.have trouble syncing it with my phone, but we got it worked out and now it is great.  I wish the Urban had a darker bracelet that matched it better (grey tracker and tan bracelet dont match well IMO,) but the new nude colour is pretty. I just would like to have the option of a pewter or black one with siver hardware. (There is a black one with rose gold hardware which is beautiful with the rose gold tracker!) Ive been using it for 2 weeks and so far i have had a great expience with it.  It tracks activity, sleep, your period and even gives you an indication of hold vulnerable you will be to stress given the amount of sleep, exercise, meditation and where in your cycle you might be.  I even tried the guided meditation, which I dont ever do, and also found I enjoyed it.  The bedtime meditation was so great i ended up falling with my glasses still.on!

2016-12-14,"Prior to using Bellabeat I used UP Jawbone for several years. When I read about this tracker, I was very intrigued by this tracker's ability to track stress and also liked the fact that you have several options with regard to how you wear it and it looks like a nice piece of jewelry.  I think this is a fantastic product and the fact that you don't have to recharge it is wonderful!  I am also enjoying the meditation options that are available with the tracker.  My favorite is the deep sleep meditation for when I am going to sleep.  I believe a fitness tracker is very helpful to keeping one focused on staying healthy and wear my tracker daily. I should get lots of use from this tracker.",I was very intrigued by this tracker's ability to track stress and also liked the fact that you have several options with regard,5
2017-01-17,"I really like having a tracker that's different from what everyone else seems to have. The Leaf is attractive and versatile, I can clip it to my shirt, pants, bra, or wear it as jewelry. The clip is nice and secure.  I enjoy tracking my sleep as well as my activity and I also enjoy the meditation exercises on the app.  The alarm wakes me up with a gentle vibration instead of an annoying noise every morning.  I purchased and received the original design but then realized I would prefer the Urban for its water resistance.  There is no number to call bellabeat, so I emailed. They took a couple of days to respond, but in the end my money was promptly refunded, my original device was deactivated- so I didn't have to bother sending it back, which was nice (now I have extra accessories)-and I went ahead and  purchased the Urban.  I have no complaints so far, for me this is a fun device to have.",Not the same old tracker,5

Since then, I have not taken it off. I really prefer wearing it as a bracelet, and find it is a great accessory. I wanted it as an alternative to the Fitbit, for a few reasons: 1. I found that everyone that I see has a Fitbit, and it is not original. 2. The Fitbit is very sporty looking. One feature of the Bellabeat is that you can wear it as a formal accessory while still tracking your steps and activity. I love how it is more focused around overall health verses just activity. The period tracking feature is very interesting and unlike anything I have seen.Overall, I am very happy with my Bellabeat and rave about it to anyone who asks!",and find it is a great accessory.

I typically wear it as a bracelet, but I love that I have 2 other options as well. The only issue I have with the urban is they have yet to put up replacement bracelets for this style.

2017-01-23,"This health tracker is beautiful and easy to use.  I know when to expect my period now, which is great, and I've found that I'm much more likely to track it when all I have to do is tap a screen (rather than fill in a paper calendar or similar).  It also does a great job tracking my sleep automatically through a process I'm convinced must involve witchcraft.  All that I need to do is be wearing the Leaf, and it knows when I'm sleeping very accurately.  Because I am an insomniac who suffers from anxiety, this is a huge help.  It also allows me to set goals for meditation and then track how much I much meditate using an integrated guided meditation program.  Because it is so easy to use and so easy to see my progress, I've found that I'm meditating much more frequently, which, again, is great for my anxiety.  I have the leaf Urban in rose gold and several people have complimented me on what a beautiful piece of jewelry it is and are amazed to find out that it has such awesome functionality.",Bellabeat Leaf Urban in Rose Gold,5
2017-01-23,"I absolutely LOVE my Leaf Urban! I wear it all the time and have gotten dozens of compliments on my ""bracelet"", people are pleasantly surprised when I tell them that it more than just an accessory. I really enjoy seeing the quality of sleep each night, I am very competitive so I like to make sure to meet my 8hr goal each day just so I can fill up the tally. It is interesting to see how inactive I was/am with my job and it serves as a reminder to get up and moving, especially since I have it set to vibrate after one hour of inactivity. I do have one negative, while I do love the bracelet that it comes with I am very upset that it doesn't clasp closed. I have had my Leaf Urban for almost a month now and it's fallen off twice, thankfully I caught it mid fall both times but this makes me incredibly nervous. I have been contemplating buying a non branded clasp bracelet but afraid of the construction on them and whether they will hold up to daily use. I hope that some day very soon that Bellabeat comes out with a bracelet that clasps!",Leaf Urban Rose Gold,5
2017-05-02,"The Bellabeat gets a ton of attention for it's physical appearance when I wear mine daily! It also works pretty well monitoring all that it does on a daily basis for steps and sleep pattern. I wear a bellabeat on one wrist and a fitbit on the other to see which is more accurate or fit me better! They both are great! The fitbit is more like a watch style, it shows the date, time, your heart beat, and calories burned, steps taken, and calls/messages as they come in etc. BUT, you do have to charge it every other day! The band breaks easily! I have had to replace mine twice over 6 months. The Bellabeat has a battery internally that you do not have to change, but every 6 months or so. It monitors so much more for a woman than that of the fitbit like menstrual cycle, ovulation etc, along with programs you can add for free on your phone to help better your relaxing and stress. All apps are free to download sync whether it be bellabeat or fitbit.  SO, the price ranging the same as the fitbit they both are great devices. Compliments more on the bellabeat and looks more nice than the fitbit. Fitbit you have more friends you can compete and challenge to stay on healthy goals with. Bellabeat does not have that feature, It focuses more on menstrual, ovulation, stress/meditation, sleep pattern and steps per day, more of a healthy you while looking classy rather than worry about competition with others wearing a block looking watch as a fitbit. I do love both however for their own uniqueness. Mine are both rosegold! The bellabeat is more accurate than fitbit on sleep and steps. Hope this helps!",Bellabeat- The Classier way to wear a health tracking device!,5
2017-01-20,"I love my Bellabeat! I have had other fitness trackers before, but I have never been excited to wear one before this. It really does look like a beautiful piece of jewelry. It's a beautiful statement piece when worn as a necklace, or a delicate touch of rose gold when clipped on your shirt.As far as tracking goes, it does an excellent job tracking my sleep and waking me up with a gentle vibration in time for work. It is quite accurate for tracking activities as well. I love the built in menstrual cycle tracking, something that other trackers don't have. The built in meditation exercises are also one of a kind.If you want to have the functions of a fitness tracker that does so much more, but the idea of strapping a tiny computer to your wrist every morning doesn't appeal to you, I highly recommend adding the Leaf to your shopping cart. It will become your new staple piece!",My new staple piece!,5
2017-01-23,"I came across the leaf while searching through my pintrest feed one day. I did my research and got excited about a device upon reading the descripiton. It is chic and promotes health which is a little different than other brands. I get compliments all the time! My favorite part is the meditation, they have a few that allow you to do 3-10 minutes worth and i can tell you it is awesome. They are really tapping into a different aspect of health that most choose to ignore, which is inner peace. Overall, it is encouraging a community for the better of self.I have not experienced any unaccurate steps, regardless it still challenges you to reach your goal. You can track your fertility, or not. I love how it tracks your sleep and tells you the waves of deep and light sleep you fall into. I love my leaf!I look forward to some minor adjustments on the app in regards to being able to input more data. My only thing is the clips are kinda hard when putting on but it never falls off on me. I also did have some weird scratches on the black part but not noticeable to care.  Highly recommended!",Bellabeat Leaf Rose Gold,5
2016-12-14,"I absolutely LOVE the LEAF URBAN. It tracks your menstruation cycle/fertility days, steps, calories, sleep, mediation and SOO much more. I love how when you input an ""activity"" (e.g, soccer, yoga, rock climbing etc..) it literally has every possible activity you could imagine- INCLUDING SEX! hahaha I wear it day and night (I do take it off to shower although it does say somewhere that it can get wet but not ""submerged"" into water). I am noticing that the bracelet is already starting to fray and wear significantly since I got it 2 months ago. Not sure if this is normal or not but I have contacted customer support and so far they have been VERY HELPFUL. Even with that, I'm still giving it a 5/5. Aside for the FUNCTION, it is SO fashionable! I can't tell you how many people compliment me on my bracelet- and when I tell them its a fitness tracker- they say ""WOW! That's SOO cool!",I absolutely LOVE the LEAF URBAN,5
2017-05-18,"This is the fourth fitness tracker I've tried (including just my phone) and this is my favorite.  The best part for me is that I wear it all the time, and don't  have to remember to take it with me (like my phone), or miss steps because it's got to sit and charge for a few hours.It's also beautiful, feels solid and well-made, came with a nice bracelet, and a beautiful necklace, and the app is simple and self-explanatory.  I like the meditation feature as a reminder to take time for myself - there are several kinds of mediation or breathing exercises to choose from depending on what your goal is for that particular session.  And the cycle tracker is such a good idea!But my favorite part is that I get this beautiful secret tracker that I don't have to charge every other day!","Beautiful, practical, easy!",5
2016-11-23,"I purchased the rose gold leaf urban from the manufacturers website. I absolutely love it. I love all the features.I love the meditation portion. It provides you with guided sessions.Also, I was surprised to find that the vibrating alarm does wake me up. It also has discrete alarms you set throughout the day as needed.I'm a stressful person so it's nice to see how all the features are used to predict stress. It helps me do everything I can to keep the stress percentage low (of course this includes taking more steps, meditating, and sleeping the appropriate time).And of course it looks great. I've gotten a lot of compliments about it.I highly suggest this. I never take it off.",Love it!!!,5
2017-01-22,"After a year of Bellabeat Leaf Urban being advertised on my search engine and social networking sites, I decided to finally buy one for me and my mother for Christmas. I love my Leaf Urban. I get so many compliments on it, and I get very excited to tell everyone that it's not just a lovely piece of jewelry, it's a health tracker, too! I have found the best place to wear it to get the most accurate reading of movement is on your wrist. It doesn't seem to track very well when worn like a brooch. I know this because when I set a movement alarm (basically, if I sit still for 3 hours, it buzzes at me to get off my butt (I'm a law student, so sitting for 3 hours reading is not uncommon)), it buzzes at me even when I have been up and walking around, so I'm guessing it doesn't register quite as well. But I still love it. I love that it tracks my sleep and I absolutely LOVE the guided meditations and wake-up alarms. My mom loves hers, too. She tells me how she also gets compliments all the time. Definitely a great gift for the women in your life.","Finally, a stylish heath tracker!",5
2016-12-13,"I've had the leaf for about a month and love it! I mostly use it as a bracelet during the day and clip it to my shirt when I sleep, and it's so comfortable, I never realize it's there.  I haven't worked out with it, because even though it's water resistant, I do sweat a lot and don't want to ruin it, but luckily you can add activity/workouts in the app, so workouts and showers are the only time I'm not using the leaf.I have noticed that I sync it with my phone a few times throughout the day and it pushes me to get more steps, because I always want to make sure I meet my daily goal (which you can set yourself).  It also syncs with the iPhone Health app, which is nice.I've also gotten so many compliments on it - some people wonder if it's just a pretty bracelet/necklace or a tracker!  My sister-in-law had the fitbit and found it uncomfortable, she saw my lead and really liked it, and next thing I know, my brother found out she was interested in one and he ordered her one for Christmas.  Overall, I love it and would recommend!","It's been a month, but love it!",5
2017-01-13,"I have been wanting a Bellabeat for quite a while now and I am very glad I finally purchased one. First of all, it is so pretty! I have received so many compliments on it and it matches everything :-) Secondly, and most importantly I love the way it has helped me become accountable for my well being. Tracking my steps has made me realize I need to get moving quite a bit more and tracking my sleep has really made me realize that I do not get enough of it and that I need to make some changes to become a better, healthier me and I believe my Bellabeat is going to help me become that person.",Best Decision I've Made!,5
2016-12-10,"Love my leaf urban!  I get compliments on it all the time.  It's like a nice piece of jewelery.  I have a treaddesk and had a little difficulty finding the best placement for my leaf so my steps register properly on my leaf.  I contacted leaf customer service and they recommended placement.  I clip it on my waist band,  shirt,  bra or wear it as a necklace.I love the mediation feature,  although I don't use it as often as I should.  I also luke that you can set alarms for various things.  I set it to go off to remind me to take my daily vitamin.  I get a gentle vibration when it's time and it's worked great!I highly recommend this Tackett for anyone who's tired of wearing those clunky fitness trackers.  This does the same thing and is much nicer to wear.",Great fitness tracker with the luxury of jewelery,5
2017-03-08,"I am absolutely in love with my Bellabeat Leaf Urban. I have convinced 3 other people to buy them since I've had it (around two weeks). It was a birthday present but I would have paid for it in a heartbeat. TI have the black/rose gold combination and wear it with the black bracelet. I get compliments about my ""bracelet"" and people cannot believe it when I tell them it's also a fitness tracker! I love the little quotes and words of encouragement. They're motivating and sometimes funny. My rose gold clip has gotten scratched a little bit (though I did wear it as a bracelet while rock climbing so that's probably on me). I'm going to try to buff it out with a polishing cloth or just get a new clip (you can buy them separately! The ONLY thing I would improve is adding a heartbeat tracker.","If you want to blow people's minds with a beautiful piece of jewelry that also tracks your activity, buy this!",5
2019-01-26,"As others have said, I REALLY wanted to love this but ultimately that wasn't possible.Cons:- Step tracker: not accurate. I've used it in combination with a variety of other step trackers and it dramatically overestimates the amount of steps I've taken which makes it difficult as a standalone step tracker.- Period tracker: bare bones. I have other apps that provide much more insightful period tracking. The device itself does nothing for tracking, it's just a module in the mobile app.- Water resistance: not great. The product advertises that it can be worn in the shower but it seems that I wore it for too long of a shower and 1 month into having the tracker, it's completely dead and I guess now I'll use it as a cute paperweight.- Sleep tracker: ok. Works best when clipped to something tight to your body - but if you wear loose PJs, this isn't possible. I have 2 young kids so I'm frequently up in the middle of the night and the tracker often doesn't accurately identify these waking times. There's no way to edit overnight details, just your ""went to bed"" and ""woke up"" times, and if you edit those, you ""lose"" the times you were awake overnight. This made it barely valuable as a sleep tracker.Pros:- Meditation components. I like having these pieces, but could easily find a free/cheap standalone app that doesn't cost me over $100.- Variety of ways to wear it. I like that it comes with a bracelet and necklace and that you can clip it on.- Thick (I knew this going in) but sleek and attractive looking.Overall, I think next I'll try something a little more accurate that provides a little more of that classic ""wearable"" functionality.","Great idea, poorly executed",2
2017-01-21,"I love it! It's a beautiful and stylish piece of jewelry and it keeps me motivated, active and healthier. I love that it clips to my shirt, can be a worn as a necklace or my favorite as a bracelet. I get so many compliments on how pretty it is and few know it is really an activity tracker until I tell them. I also like the built in meditation sessions in the app. I only wish I had bought it sooner.",Love it!,5
2017-01-23,"I received my Bellabeat urban for Christmas and have been using it nonstop since. One of my students (a high school freshman) had one and was sold on it after she told me about it. I love that it is feminine and looks like jewelry. Many of my female colleagues and students have complimented it and were shocked that its actually a piece of technology. I find it easy to wear as it is very light and I am pleased that it can track sleep, stress, activity, cycles and meditation. The app is free and easy to use as well. I dislike having anything on my wrists and never wear watches! I had debated getting a Fitbit just because I needed something to track my activity but was very reluctant to have something on my arm. The Bellabeat is perfect for me. The only catch that I've found so far is that when I have it on as a clip, depending on the thickness of the material, it has slipped off a handful of times. Other than that, I love it!",Wearable technology that is pretty as well as functional.,5
2021-02-13,"I love the idea of having a tracker that doesn't look like a tracker. I want to track my steps to help me be more active, but this one doesn't work well. It doesn't accurately track my steps regardless of how I wear it. And it doesn't sync well with the app to let me know how many steps I've managed to accrue in the day. I can wear the tracker for an hour, walk on and off for much of that time, staying active, and the tracker will sometimes track 0 steps, sometimes a few hundred, and sometimes a thousand, for the same amount of walking. It has much of the same problem with tracking sleep, thinking I'm wearing it when I'm not. I can leave it laying on my nightstand where it doesn't move and in the morning it will think I had a restless night of sleep and that it was clipped to my shirt. I also don't like that it forces you to track other features for an accurate stress level. I hydrate plenty, but I don't feel the need to track every glass of water I drink and there's no way to turn this feature off. In theory, this kind of tracker is a good idea, but it doesn't work well at all! I'm completely frustrated and won't be wearing it anymore.","I love the idea, but it's not well developed",2
2016-12-23,"I've had my Leaf Urban for just over seven weeks now and I think it's great.  I bought the rose gold edition and it looks just like a lovely piece of jewellery (I wear it around my wrist most of the time). However, sync it with the mobile app and after a wee while it will have enough information to provide meaningful trends on your sleep (not just how long, but quality of sleep too), your exercise patterns and stress levels.  I love the meditation function - I've recently been practising more mindfulness and this part of the app really helps - the mediations are mostly quite short and so they're easy to fit into your day (my favourite is the 'deep sleep' meditation for right before bedtime!).  I've yet to see how the period tracking function handles my having polycystic ovary syndrome (which means that, amongst other things, I don't have a regular cycle) and I've still to find the best way to wear my Leaf for different activities.  Overall, though, it's a great health tracker - much more than just a pedometer!",Useful health tracker,5
2017-01-03,"I have been using my Leaf for several months now, and I love that it is versatile and tracks multiple functions. I also appreciate that it has alarms, and I use it daily to wake me up and remind me to take vitamins. After trial and error I found wearing it as a bracelet is the most accurate for counting activity. And I think it is important to note that unlike other fitness trackers that may count every step a person takes, the Leaf is tracking 'activity' which means you have to do more than wander around for it to count steps. I appreciate this for telling me just how active I am. I do wish the accuracy was higher when wearing it as a necklace or clipped on to clothing.... maybe in a future version? I receive compliments on how pretty the Leaf is, and most often people guess that it is jewelry and not a fitness tracker. I hope this Leaf lasts for a LONG time, however I can see myself purchasing another one when needed.",Love my Leaf!,5
2018-08-25,"I was so excited when I bought this (purchased it directly from their website, not Amazon), but there were a few things that were disappointing:- couldn't wear it with the bracelet because the bracelet was too small for my wrist- I ended up wearing on my pants, but it kept falling of every once in a while. One time it fell of at a dr's appt and the dr called me to tell me that she had found it and asked if it was mine. Another time it fell of at the gas station. And one last time it fell off when I was at the supermarket and I didn't realize that it fell off until I got home. Needless to say, I lost the leaf and have not been able to find it, so I'm out $130. :(- had to go to the app every time I wanted to check my steps, which is not a big problem, but I had to press a SYNC button and then I had to tap my leaf a few times before it would tell me how many steps I walked. Sometimes this was inconvenient because, for example, I would take it off at night and leave it in my bathroom and if I wanted to check my steps for the day right before bed, I had to get up, get the leaf, tap it a few times and then I could finally see how many steps I walked that dayOverall, I like the features of the leaf, but I wish I didn't lose it because it fell off my pants. So disappointed.","Really wanted to love this, but...",3
2017-01-12,"The versatility of this fitness tracker is its best feature! Being able to switch from a bracelet to a necklace to a clip is very convenient, and its design is clean and polished enough to wear in a variety of settings, professional and casual. This is a big plus that other trackers don't offer.The fit is good and it is lightweight. The app is reliable and the sleep tracking is very accurate!The one con of this product is the bracelet accessory, which stretches out a bit over time and occasionally comes unclasped. This is not a huge issue, as it would be very easy to swap it out for another bracelet accessory.Overall fantastic product!","Looks great, works great!",5
2016-12-13,"I've never had a fitness tracker before, mainly because I don't want to wear a plastic band around my wrist and/or advertise this to everyone I see.  The Leaf is subtle and versatile, with many different ways to wear it.  And I love that it tracks more than just activity, since I have a pretty good handle on what I do and do not do each day....  but this also tracks sleep, which is great and which has led me to try to get better rest each night.  The app is very user friendly and provides lots of feedback in different formats, so that you can monitor how you are doing with your different goals.  And another big bonus is the meditation exercises, which are led.  I am tragic at meditating on my own (wandering mind....), but these exercises really keep me focused and, therefore, are much more helpful than me just trying it on my own.  Anyway, I love this thing and, have worn it all the time since I got it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to focus on overall well being!",It's great!,5
2017-01-13,"After looking at other fitness trackers, I fell in love with the Bellabeat Leaf Urban for a few reasons. First, I liked the look of it and the versatility of wearing options. I really liked the meditations and the feedback integrated with my phone. I also liked that the design really seemed to tap into my needs and preferences as a woman. I purchased it in December 2016 and all of my expectations were met!Other reviewers noted that the Leaf falls off of the bracelet because of the open hooks. This has not been my experience, though a new wearer would want to spend some time adjusting the strap to find a comfortable position. Otherwise, the Leaf doesn't track with as much accuracy.I would like to see the technology advance so that the Leaf can integrate with other apps. It does work with the Health app on my iPhone, but I'd love to be able to connect with MyFitnessPal.",I fell in love with the Bellabeat Leaf Urban for a few reasons,5

It links to an app where you can track all kinds of helpful health information and it even comes loaded with a bunch of meditations which I love!!  I have been a fitbit wearer for years and while I have no complaints about my fitbit, I love the uniqueness of this product and the fact that it is specially designed for women to meet your unique health tracking needs.  Great investment in yourself and your health!  So glad I made the change.",Beautiful and perfectly functional,5

I make jewelry as a hobby and have made several pretty bands to wear instead of the plain band it came with. It's perfect for me!",Love it! Love it,5
2017-01-19,"I have to say I do love this product. It's cute, it serves as a reminder to keep my daily stressers in check and it's relatively user friendly .There are some things I do wish it was updated to include . If I were on the development team for improving this product here's what I would do to improve its value to the average target market . First, while I know this has been addressed as ""unimportant"" the name of the product is misleading , it's called Bella beat, but it doesn't actually track your heart beat , and while this is a stress management device, I would beg the question , wouldn't it be interesting to track your heart rate during stressful times and actually have it ask the consumer when it sensed an elevated heart rate if there was something particularly stressful that occurred , those of us in nursing for example,  deal with many outside stressors that are unrelated to how much sleep or activity we get, it would be nice to track that and see if cognizance would help us identify what most commonly affects us and then work to decrease those incidence if possible . Next, a nutrition advisor on the app that tracked calories and nutritional intake would be an amazing feature , this is the biggest concern of women it seems everywhere I go, I feel like to have this feature included much like the meditation feature would be an extremely helpful and valuable asset . Lastly, the design is so awesome but the bracket (which is my favorite) easily unhooks and falls off , it would be nice to have the openings on either side close so this doesn't happen, it's too cute too lose and it would be a really sad loss . Thanks Bella beat !","Awesome , can't wait for further R&D",4
2016-11-15,"I've had this product for almost a month, and so far I love it! I used to have a Fitbit, and I have to say that I like the Leaf quite a bit better. For one, I don't worry about it falling off without my knowledge - this is how I lost the Fitbit. It snapped off while I was working and I didn't know until it was far too late. I wear the leaf as a bracelet, and while it's a little loose and does sometimes come unclasped, it's never in a situation when I can't catch it.Also one of my favorite things are the little positive encouragements that pop up! Each day you get a new health tip and when you click into each tab on the app it'll give you a little confidence booster.Overall, it's pretty, seems to be pretty accurate, and tracks more than a Fitbit or other tracker would (meditation, menstrual cycle, AND resistance to stress, all of which I've found useful). Highly recommend!",Definitely recommend,5
2017-07-05,"I just laundered my Leaf accidentally (ran through both washer and dryer cycles) which is not recommended as it is only ""water resistant"".

2016-12-13,"I have had the Leaf Urban now for a month and I am very happy with the product. It combines practicality with beautiful design. Generally speaking does it what most fitness trackers register and a little more: it tracks your sleep, your steps. On top of that, it lends you a hand in meditation and tracks your period, if you wish to use that feature. The app has a very nice, beautiful and intuitive design and it uses the data that it collects to predict your stress resistance! Brilliant !The leaf itself is so beautiful and I have received compliments from people who thought it was a gorgeous piece of jewelry. You can wear it on a necklace around your neck, attached to your cloths or with a bracelet on your wrist. The latter is my personal preference.The only downside for me is that it doesn't track sleep before 9pm, but I have talked to customer service and they assured me that their tech team is working on it.",I love my Leaf ! :),5
2016-11-11,"First I want to say, although I miss the design of the first leaf - nature edition(I had the silver with the black bracelet), there are many things I do love about the urban.The urban is water resistant, which is a huge plus, especially when you get caught in a downpour while hiking. I also think its does a better job at tracking steps than my original leaf did. So far I have had no issues with it, and im thankful for that.The new stress tracking feature is a great idea, but it has a long way to go. I have yet to go over 23% stress level according to the app, which I highly doubt is the reality.The good news as always is that Bellabeat is a great company, that actually listens to its customers, and strives to improve their product. If you ever have an issue, they will work with you to resolve it.It tracks everything I need it to. Steps, my cycle, has meditation exercises, and you can enter other activities as well. I also love all the options for how to wear it.I still constantly get complements on my urban. If you could find a way to create one that looks like the original leaf, but is water resistant and as accurate as the current, I would be ecstatic.",Great product!,5
2017-01-23,"I love how it looks esthetically, I love that you have several options on how you can wear it. I am 240 pounds so the bracelet is a little too snug for me to wear. That may actually be my only complaint about it. Due tot his fact I typically wear it clipped on to my bra and it stays there all day and all night. I feel that it is very accurate with sleep tracking. It seems accurate with steps but I haven't verified that. Overall it does what it says it does and it looks very stylish so I have been very happy with mine which I received as a gift. The app is also really good. I have used other fitness trackers and their app was horrible.",Very happy,5
2017-01-13,"I am just loving my Leaf! I've seen it advertised on several social media outlets, so when I finally looked into it, I was surprised at all it had to offer!  It offers so much more than just being a fitness tracker. I love how it incorporates tracking my stress level, sleep patterns, and meditation habits. For so long I have been trying to be better at meditating daily, but just could not find the motivation or ""insurance"" to get it done. I now catch myself when I don't sit down and meditate, because now combined with the app I can see my progress and how it does help me in my daily routine.Not only is it practical, but its cute too! I love how versatile it is to wear, becoming a part of my wardrobe!I would recommend this to anyone!",I love how it incorporates tracking my stress level,5

I am have been considering using only the calendar method for my birth control in order to keep foreign objects and chemicals out of my body and with the way the leaf tracks my cycle and fertile days is perfect. Its recommended to get about 6 months worth of data so that the tracker can get a really good idea of your body since, if you're like me, your cycle can change based on stress. Eventually, with the help of the leaf, I think I'll be able to do just that! I also love the gentle reminder that I'm being lazy. when I'm siting at my desk working and feel that gentle buzz, I know I need to get up and take a break. I think the leaf is well worth the money and its a great way to monitor your health to be the best woman you can be!",I love my leaf,5

So far, I'm loving it! I am able to track my activity, sleep, water, and periods. The tracker is really cute and easy to wear. I have also loved the meditation feature. ""Deep Sleep"" is my favorite guided meditation. I would suggest the Bellabeat for anyone who is interested in wellness and wants a smart, attractive device to track it.",Beautiful Wellness Tracker,5
2017-01-14,"I asked for the Leaf Urban for Christmas, and have worn it almost every day since then. It does just what I was looking for - step tracking, monitoring of inactivity periods (I can easily sit at my desk for 4 hours without moving - and now I get prompted with a gentle vibration when that happens), and a reminder to take time for myself and meditate. I have always loved leaves and have a number of leaf pins and necklaces, but this is the first that ""works"" for me. If I were to ask for it to do one more thing, that would be to unobtrusively display the time. I always wear my Leaf as a bracelet and there are some days at work when I really need to watch the time, and now I hate to strap an extra watch on.",Love leaves and my Leaf!,5
2017-01-13,"I really love how it looks - no one knows exactly what it is and are totally blown way when I explain all that it does.  I feel it is so much more than the other fitness tracker out there, because it's better - it tracks ways to keep my health good and stress levels low.  I really enjoy that I can wear it 3 different ways, but mostly I wear it as a bracelet.I would recommend this to anyone - it's like wearing a very pretty piece of jewelry - like they say 'smart jewelry' and it is.",Love it!,5
2016-12-09,I have been wearing my Bellabeat for a month now and absolutely love it! It tracks just what I want and I can turn off the items that don't interest me. I also find myself using the meditation nearly every night to clear my head and then sleeping like a baby. I wear mine as a bracelet and get compliments all the time. I have purchase 2 more as Christmas gifts for family members whom gush over it already. You can't go wrong with this purchase.,I'm in love with my Bellabeat Leaf Urban!,5
2017-01-08,"I finally received my Bellabeat Urban as a late Christmas present to myself after USPS lost it in transit for almost three weeks, but thankfully it showed up for the start of the new year. I've been using it for a couple weeks now.Initial reactions -- it beat my expectations. It's looks like a really attractive piece of jewelry. I wish it were a little thinner, I like to sleep with my hand under my pillow, but I'm getting used to it. I can see what people mean about the bracelet coming out of the clasps too easily. For me that is only a problem when putting it on. It can be a real pain because you have to hold it really still while you fasten it else the straps slip out and you have to start over. While wearing it though, it is pulled taught enough that there is no concern about it coming apart, it feels very secure. I personally think the clasps look better than lobster clasps, but I hope in the next redesign they'll consider fashioning some type of closed clasp. I also wish they offered the wrap bands in additional colors, I would love a white band. The bracelet itself could stand to be a little longer on my wrist, but being leather I'm expecting it to stretch so it's absolutely not a problem for me.The alarm vibrations are discreet but noticeable, this is something I really wanted and was one of the main reasons I decided to buy a fitness tracker.The other main reason is for sleep tracking, and this is why I truly love this bracelet. At first it didn't seem accurate--for example, one night it said I went to sleep at 1:15 when in fact I was asleep by midnight because I was awoken by a text at 12:10. I chalked that up to a lot of tossing and turning in that first hour though. However, the Leaf appears to be learning my rhythms because it is quite right about the times that I am in a deep sleep and a light sleep, and when I wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for a couple hours. It has really helped to open my eyes about how little sleep I'm giving myself. I used to think I got plenty of sleep because I would go to bed at 9 or 10. But the Leaf reminds me that most nights I don't actually go to sleep until midnight or later (because I lay there playing on my phone or reading). At first I was shocked to wake up every morning and see I had only slept 6 hours, but I'm realizing that's my own doing and I need to work on it.As far as it's pedometer feature, the jury is still out. I feel like it's giving me a lot more steps than I'm actually taking. And I'm quite certain it's recording certain arm movements I make sitting down as steps. I need to do more walking though, hopefully it will adjust itself the way the sleep tracker has.The app is okay. I don't use the meditation feature and wish there a way to remove it from view. Instead it would be nice to input calories or something like that for diet. I also wish it was integrated with iPhone's 'Bedtime' feature because I use that every night. But I realize the app is very fluid and will progressively get better, so fingers crossed!Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. It was a little pricier than I wanted to spend, but considering it's such a nicer looking fitness tracker than what's out there, that's small potatoes. Now if they would add a small watch face or digital clock display to the next version, I would be all set!","Lovely and stylish, great for tracking sleep.",4
2016-11-26,"I think it is a very great tracker. To begin with, it looks great and matches my jewelry.I saw a picture of it online and noticed that lovely leaf. It took me to their website. I was impressed and had to send the link to my hubby. If I usually judge by the look, he has to research the device. Even he agreed that it was pretty ""solid."" And no need to charge the battery. It is honestly a good tracker. I haven't had any problems or concerns.",This tracker will make your wife happy,5
2016-11-15,I have been considering getting a health fitness tracker for a few years but having to charge it and wear a wristband to indefinitely were a deal breaker (most people I know tossed their fitness wristbands into drawers after a while for those reasons so didn't feel like wasting money to do the same). When I saw leaf urban on the market I was happy and have been wearing mine as a pendant since I got in October. This is my first health tracker so I can't compare it to other products but overall I enjoy the functions come with my leaf urban so far- also it has great build in breathing meditation exercises.,... after a while for those reasons so didn't feel like wasting money to do the same),5
2017-02-21,"First the pros: It's attractive and well made, and it's pretty subtle as far as fitness trackers go. It's also very easy to use right out of the box. Customer service was fabulous every time I contacted them. The app was free, easy to use, and provided useful information. I wanted to love it, I really did.The cons: Despite its name, the Bellabeat Leaf does NOT track heart rate at all. From the beginning, I was disappointed that my stress sensitivity was simply based on exercise and meditation instead of heartbeat or other biometrics. Similarly, the sleep sensor is based on movement, so I had more than a few nights when I slept restlessly and my morning report said I was a champion sleeper. It even missed times when I got up and walked around in the middle of the night. I also was never fully confident in the Leaf Urban as a step counter, even on the best days. Finally, if it's a product for all women, I wish the website would have at least one woman that's remotely close to plus sized.The final straw for me came about a month after having the thing when, after a very busy day on my feet, I was told I'd taken 67 steps. After syncing it a while later, it said I walked for 0 minutes, but made it 1564 steps and .66mi. The next day, I magically walked 2.5 miles in 11 minutes -- I'm a fast walker, but an Olympic speed walker. Again, customer service was very helpful, but in the end I decided I needed something I could trust more and I returned it.",I wanted to love it,2
2016-12-21,"I received my Leaf Urban for my birthday and have had it about two months now. I had always looked at activity tracker but just never liked them enough to buy until I found this one. Had I not gotten it as a gift, I'd have bought it myself. I love the look and how it can be worn several ways. It's like a piece of wearable artwork. The sleep tracker and meditation exercises are probably my favorite and most useful parts of the tracker. I'm always on the go so seeing exactly how much sleep I'm getting and if it's a deep sleep, is helpful in making sure I'm not dragging by the end of the week. Meditation has been something I wanted to get into and understand better so having these guided exercises has been a great introduction to meditating and very enjoyable. This is definitely be something that I wear and use everyday!",Stylish and Useful,5
2017-01-20,I have had my bellabeat for a month! It's very comfortable on my wrist which is my favorite way to wear it! I am enjoying tracking my sleep and steps and I'm improving my steps!

I have recommended it to purchase to many friends!,It's very comfortable on my wrist which is my favorite way to ...,5
2016-11-10,"I absolutely love this product! I have only been wearing it for a few weeks, but it is already making me more aware of my daily activity and how much sleep I am having. It is really accurate (I usually wear mine clipped to my top or bra strap) and the option to add extra activities is great. The alarms are a fantastic extra feature, especially if you are forgetful like me. I can never normally remember to take vitamins for more than a few days, but having a little vibration at the same time everyday is a godsend. The fact that it doesn't need to be plugged into the mains to charge is another plus for me, as I know that I would forget to put it on when it was done. I haven't tested how long the data is stored for, as I'm always too excited to see what I have achieved in the day! Love love love!!!",Love it!,5
2016-12-28,"When I first saw Lolo Jones wearing it, I was intrigued. Waited for a little bit and thwn signed up for the notifications for the urban leaf. I purchased it from the website during the second wave of preorders. I finally got it and havent taken it off since. I love that it tracks my steps and has guided meditations. The period tracker is amazing too since I'm so busy it's hard to keep track of when I'm expected. I also really like tracking ym sleeping, being a high performance athlete, it really let's me understand the dips in my performances during my training sessions. Thanks for an amazing product and so happy it finally arrived!!",Loving it!,5
2017-01-12,"This product is great. I really love the app & data that is associated with it. The really strong features of it include:1) steps & associated data2) sleep! monitors sleep & periods of being awake, including deep/light sleep (which I assume is tracked by movement).3) meditation! I haven't yet been using this feature as I too often have my little people around me and have very little time to myself, but I think I think the concept seems great & can see myself using it in the future.4) stress tracking--which combines your data from the other sections to give you an overall analysis5) (for women-) period tracking6) I have already received numerous compliments and am always delighted to tell people it's not just jewelryI would love to give it 5 stars, but there are a few things I haven't yet figured out, or that would be helpful to add/adjust...1) I am a mom of two very small kids. It's quite helpful to use the sleep tracker. It even identifies periods of being awake. However, if I tell the app I want to ""adjust"" the sleep period, the ""awake"" period that it accurately detected, has gone away. Further, it seems this editing is limited only to the start and stop times. It would be great to see this streamlined.2) I haven't yet figured out how to adjust my stride/steps. I wish it were easier to update as I think it's giving me credit for more steps than I'm taking.3) I prefer the bracelet and I'd prefer to wear it looser but when I do, the bracelet band slips out too easily from the pendant connector. It's alright, but at the size I need to wear it to protect it from falling off it leaves a small mark on my arm.4) the suggestion is to wear the leaf ""down"" but it's unclear which direction that is on your wrist.",love this,4
2017-01-02,"I love the leaf. It is stylish and very easy to use. I really like that it tracks meditation and has manual entry for meditation and for exercise. I really like the flexibility it has in changing from a necklace to a bracelet, to a pin that I can easily put on a sports bra. I do wish it would show heart rate before and after work outs.",I love the leaf,5
2021-02-26,"I bought this in January directly from Bellabeat because I loved the look of the Crystal.I find it very difficult. It doesn't function well around other Bluetooth devices, it doesn't track accurately as a bracelet, and it frequently doesn't sync because it can't find the device!Well, as of last night,  it stopped syncing all together after less than 2 months! I tried all the trouble shooting tips on the website. which includes turning Bluetooth on and off, restarting the phone, all for nothing. I emailed their Customer Service today and was told to uninstall the app, remove the battery,  replace the battery (battery is at 3/4), reinstall the app, log in and TRY to set up the device again!Long story, short. I am throwing it out. It is not worth the time and aggrevation. For the $ I paid, it should last at least a year. This stopped working in less than 2 months. Save your money. BTW... don't expect any refund after 30 days. Bellabeat asked for more screen shots today,  but said. sorry, you are past our 30 day window for returns.Terrible company, terrible product and horrible customer service!",Pass! Save your money!,1
2017-03-03,"This works great straight out of the box. Got mine in January and hasn't needed a charge yet.  I wear it 24/7 as a necklace, pin or mainly a bracelet.  I picked this one because it's waterproof so I can shower/swim/sauna without worry.The App loaded easily to my iPhone 7+ and syncs quickly with a light doubletap on the leaf. You can update sleep to add naps, add a huge variety of activities and it even follows your cycle and guides you in meditation.  It does not let you edit data you've accepted however- at least I haven't figured it out.Improvements would be to track daily hydration- I have to use another app currently.  It would also be nice to track weight and maybe even nutrition.Highly recommend!",Fashionable Fit Tracker,4
2019-07-29,"I have had this leaf for over 2 years now. While I love the design and the features , I have to say that their app is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I have used the leaf with several different Android phones and I keep having sync issues. Almost every time my phone updates, the leaf won't sync any more. Now, I just changed the battery and it won't sync again. It is frustrating to say the least, and their customer support never really has resolved these issues. I can't even count the times that I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and unpaired and paired the leaf trying to fix the problems. So for now the leaf doesn't sync again; and when you post a review about this issue on the Play Store, their team just posts 'we're sorry , please contact the techservice'. But the tech service doesn't fix these issues. It is absolutely ridiculous that Bellabeat cannot fix these issues. A lot of people have Android phones and have problems with their app. Another thing I think is ridiculous is the fact that the app is not able to track your sleep before 9 pm. I have contacted them over 2 years ago and was told they are working on this issue. I contacted them with the same question about one of their newer trackers and got the same answer. So you still can't track your sleep before 9 pm, which is not helpful when you go to bed earlier and get up early, like a lot of people do. You can manually add a not for the time before 9 pm, but you don't get any information about the quality of your sleep when you enter a nap. This really  defeats the purpose of the sleep tracker. So as nice as the trackers look, I think they are definitely not worth the money. I cannot recommend their devices at all, because they do mot seem to be interested in resolving the technical issues their app has.",Don't waste your money,1
2016-12-15,I absolutely love my Bellabeat!! I get compliments on the look all the time - people are always surprised it's a fitness tracker! I love that it can be worn as a necklace or a clip in addition to a bracelet. It makes it way easier to wear everyday! The app is super easy to use. I love having access to meditations and tracking my fitness activities all in one. The meditations are really good too! It has been helpful with tracking my activity and sleep and reminding me to meditate - I do wish you could keep a food diary in the app as well but Overall I love it!,Love my Bellabeat!,5
2016-12-14,Fun stylish fitness tracker.  I had used UP by Jawbone for 5 years and swore I would never leave them but decided to give this tracker a try.  Absolutely love the look and the fact I don't have to charge it every few days!  It's great that its versatile and can be worn as a clip on pin or necklace however I'm a bracelet person.  I love the look of the bracelet it comes with but hate it because it doesn't actually attach to the tracker it should have a necklace clip for each end.  I have a tiny wrist and it was such a pain trying to get it tight enough everyday.  Twice it fell apart while wearing it and I just happened to be looking down.  I went to an outside vendor and bout a bead bracelet with attachable hooks for each end of the tracker.  NOW I'm very happy with this product.  I wish the app allowed for food tracking.  I had tracked my food for 10 years and I'm a little lost not doing that.  The steps seem to be fairly accurate for me I wore this band and my UP band together for a week to see what they were both recording in steps and sleep and they were very close on both.  I think the stress part of the app is a little silly it assumes if you workout your stress is low.  I workout a lot and I am a very stressed person and it shows my stress level to be at like 10 - 15% so that doesn't really work for me.  Overall I would still highly recommend this product!  I like it enough I haven't gone back to my UP band.,Stylish Tracker,4
2017-01-12,"I've had quite a few health trackers, but this one is my favorite. In the app, all the information is easy to access and navigate. The best feature in my opinion, is the alarms. The leaf vibrates to let me know when it's time to wake up and when I need to take my medicine. Super great product, I'm glad I purchased.",Worth it!,5
2017-01-24,"I received the Bellabeat Urban as a gift and have been very pleased. I was actually given four fitness trackers and has the option to keep one. I love the look and feel of the Urban, it looked a little large at first but when paired with other bracelets, you don't even notice its size. It is very accurate in counting steps and sleep - with the occasional anomaly. A more secure clasp attaching the strap to the tracker would be good, I have to wear it tighter than I would like to make sure it stays on. It's perfectly water resistant which is great because I forget to take it off in the shower. I can see me wearing out the band quickly though. I would love to see more accessories.  Overall I am delighted with it.",Love it!,5
2017-01-23,"The primary reasons I love my BellaBeat Leaf are that it tracks my activity, sleep, and both tracks stress and provides meditation sessions. And it is not a boring fitness band, but a beautifully crafted piece of jewelry. I can clip it or wear as a bracelet or pendant. The phone app is easy to use and easy to sync from the Leaf.",Love my BellaBeat Leaf,5
2017-01-19,"I got the rose gold Leaf this past Christmas, so I haven't even used it for a whole month yet, but I love it so far! It's definitely made me more conscious of how little I move around during the day, and so I've been making more of an effort to walk places instead of take the bus, and just get out and about in general. Although I can easily track my period on my own with a regular calendar, having the app keep track of it for me has been so much more convenient (I usually don't remember to count off the days, and by the time I do remember, I've forgotten when my period started.) I wish there were more long guided meditations, but the 5 and 10 minute ones are mostly pretty good. I hope they expand the meditation section more in future app updates.The Leaf itself also has an alarm feature that you can set in the app, which will make the Leaf vibrate when the alarm goes off. You can set up to four alarms: one for taking birth control, and three that you can customize for whatever you want. However, I wish that the app itself would push a notification to my phone telling me which reminder is going off because I've set all the alarms for different times of the day, but when each one goes off, I don't actually remember what the alarm is reminding me to do. Getting to the alarms is also deep in the app settings, so navigating all the way to them in order to remind myself isn't very user friendly. Not sure if it pushes a notification for birth control since I don't have that one set, but I suspect it doesn't since the other alarms don't.I agree with other reviewers that the strap bracelet can be precarious, and if you don't have it tight enough, it will definitely fall off all the time because the hooks keeping the Leaf itself in place are pretty wide. I don't use it very often, though; I generally like to wear the Leaf as a clip on my shirt or bra. However, I found that it was easier to put on (and stay on) after I had tightened it to the right length for my wrist, then used the hooks to take it on and off instead of struggling with getting the prong in and out of the holes in the leather. Sizing it the first time was actually weirdly difficult because the holes are so small.Overall, I feel like those are all really minor things, and I really like my Leaf. It's making me more aware of my physical health and how my body is doing, and it's helping me make better choices about my physical activity, my sleep, and doing more meditation. It also helps that it's super pretty!",First Impressions After <1 Month,4
2016-12-30,I absolutely love my urban leaf. I was one who did not need another health tracker BUT so glad I purchased this. I find the sleep setting very interesting and one reason I got it because I have to work on getting into a deep sleep so my body recovers. I love that I don't have to charge it! And did I mention it goes with every outfit. I recommend it for those that just want to keep track of daily life events. I also love the vibrate alarm I can set in case I fall back to sleep after the alarm in the morning. Thanks again for a great product.,Great for daily tracking.,5
2017-01-08,"Can't tell you how much I love this .. it was a birthday present, and can honestly say it's changed my whole way of thinking.Used to cut back on sleep to fit in as much work / family/ social life, but seeing the impact of higher stress via the bellabeat app has made me re- think.  This year is the start is a new healthy me making sure I track stress and counterbalance with the right amount of exercise, meditation and sleep .. all tracked by the app.  It even tells you where you are in your monthly cycle and how hormones can impact your sensitivity to stress.A really useful health tool that's also a great piece of jewellery.. so many comments from friends who want one too!",Great fitness tracker,5
2017-01-25,"I received my leaf as a thoughtful Christmas gift from my husband. So far I love how it has tracked my sleep and my cycle. The device indicated the most stressful days of my cycle and were right on target. I was never a calendar girl for tracking on my own...now this device tracks simply day by day and I am able to see ahead to better brace myself through the storm of emotions and hormones and warn my family ahead of time, even sending my husband a screen shot of the color changes was humorous for him and I also think it added validity to the misunderstood nightmare of PMS that men don't grasp because they feel fine and see no issues :). For my sleep, I had recently started a new medication and have been able to see how my sleep is actually affected the nights I skip my dose. I do wish it was a little more in depth as compared to other apps and monitors I have seen but for now it works very well for me. I love the reminders I can set and have been more diligent in taking my vitamins on schedule because it vibrates gently for the times I have set throughout the day. I am not sure how I will know when the battery is done because it has not needed changed yet, which is great because I have been wearing it daily for a month at this time. I worry I will lose it somewhere as I do clip it to my pants but so far, no issues. Clipping onto my underwear is another story. It is a bit bulky for me as a necklace so I have not worn it this way. The bracelet idea I love but the band sent with this leaf was not secure with the clasps and a bit cheaper in quality than I was anticipating for the overall quality of the leaf and I am not a fan of the tan color with the silver and grey. However, I love the versatility that is possible in ways worn other than just that of a bracelet/watch. I haven't used the meditation or exercise tracking features of the leaf as of yet just because I don't consistently meditate and I use another app for my workout, but since it is there, I have more of a desire to get into the habit just to improve my stress sensitivity scores. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it does not seem to track as many steps as even my phone does but that does not bother me. Great product. I just saw the new black and silver leaf urban and slightly wish I had that one but that is just aesthetics...I am very happy with my current gift.",So far I love my leaf...,4
2020-06-15,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Bought this for my wife and she loved it. Been using it regularly for about a year and it now has stopped syncing and recording data, still within a year so warranty is still valid. We reached out to product support and have been going back and forth with them for almost a month now started on May 23rd. They had us try a new battery even though she has been using the same batteries this whole time without issue. Had us try loosening and tight the screws, we still had the extra screws that came with it so we tried the brand new screws still no luck. They keep stalling the process and having us do there problem solving. Didn't realize when I bought this I would become a Bellabeat employee. They clearly don't stand behind their product I've seen a couple reviews with same issue. Never seen such bad customer support in my life it weighs like 4 oz they can pay $2 and we could ship it to them so they can look at it, that's how it should have started not back and forth for a month, I don't expect an outcome at this point.",Bella beat doesn't stand behind their product Warranty is a joke,1

It does help me hold myself accountable.  It would be great if it included a field to enter water consumption - something I struggle with daily... Overall - I love it.",You owe it to yourself!!,5
2017-01-01,"What a beautiful piece of smart jewelry! Was interested in a basic fitness tracker that didn't LOOK like a fitness tracker and this fit the bill. Easy to wear as a necklace, bracelet, or simply clipped to your collar or waistband, this little leaf is there for you tracking your steps, activity, sleep, and guided meditations. Vibrating alarm wakes me and reminds me to get up and move when I've been sitting for too long. The app is intuitive and attractive, lots of built-in meditation and breathing exercises. Received this as a Christmas present and absolutely love it.","Looks great, does basic fitness tracking well, exactly what I was looking for",5

2016-12-14,"I adore this tracker. I love that it runs on a battery.  Plus, the period tracker is beyond accurate.  My cycle is very unpredictable yet the tracker told me when I'd start. It's been accurate for the 2 months I've owned it.",I love that it runs on a battery,5
2017-01-20,"Lets just say comma we all like the way it looks! The issue I have with the leaf Urban is that the app continuously syncs out on my Android phone. My biggest gripe is that I can't wear it on my arm without worrying about it falling off. There are not enough affordable accessories that secure the bracelet on your arm once it's attached exclamation point. I haven't compared it to a Fitbit or any other tracking device so I cannot report on its reliability of tracking activity. I do like the fact it record my sleeping habits and provides me with information on how stressed I am. Again, if I can't wear it on my arm without worrying it's going to fall off then it becomes a waste of money. I cannot wear it as a necklace everyday I wear jewelry that fits my clothing, so I can not wear it as a necklace I prefer to wear it as a bracelet of which I am unable to do because they don't offer any clasps. I do like it and I do have hope that they will fix this problem granted so many people testify to the same issue",Pretty and intriguing but needs a better bracelet w/ clasps,4
2016-12-13,"I ordered by bellabeat leaf urban during the very first preorder. I had to wait a little while for it, but now I've had it for a few months. I LOVE IT. My favorite things are I don't have to let it know when I fall asleep, it detects it automatically. I also love that I never have to charge it. I used to have a fitbit one and that was the biggest pain point. The leaf urban runs off a watch battery so I don't have to worry about that for a while!",Overall RECOMMEND!,5
2017-01-24,"Leaf Urban:  I love the look of this tracker. I know I wouldn't wear a fitbit on my wrist, so this was really important to me.  I've had no problems with syncing.I wish that the inside of the metal portion of the clip had some sort of no slip backing on it to help it grip onto clothing. As is it slides off of a waist band way too easily. It stays on a belt loop fine, but in there is no belt loop I have to worry about it. I am so worried it is going to fall in the toilet one of these days. I wish the bracelet connected more securely as well.It would be nice to get a notification on the app when the tracker buzzes, so we know what the buzzing is for....a get up and move buzz or an alarm.It would be nice if FitBit users could somehow challenge the Leaf Urban through the app.The information gathered and analyzed is not as detailed as Fitbit info, but it is a nice basic tracker for people who want something attractive that they will actually wear.",Attractive fitness tracker option,4
2017-01-23,"I purchased my Leaf Urban just before Christmas having done a lot of research into a wide range of activity trackers. What set this apart from others for me is 2 things. Firstly, the look of it - many people have commented on how much they like my new pendant or bracelet depending on how I've worn it. Secondly, I like that it doesn't just focus on physical activity, it includes sleep, meditation, monthly cycle (can switch this off if you don't want it) and a resistance to stress % based on all of the data it stores. I love it & would highly recommend. My friend has also just bought one too as she loved mine so much!",Fantastic little gizmo!,5
2016-12-13,I love my leaf urban.  It is not a fitness tracker but a lovely health monitor. It has allowed me to really monitor my sleep habits and my daily exercise.  After a few weeks I am really aware of what I am doing and making healthy changes that I can really see.  The leaf is also a decorative price that I feel proud to wear everyday.  As I am a science teacher it wears well with all I do.  I can't hurt it.  I also bought another one for my friend.,Love my Leaf,5

The Leaf is beautiful and can be worn as a bracelet, necklace or clip and nobody even knows its a health tracker. I also like that it is battery operated and doesn't need to charge. My Nike Fuelband required charging which resulted in me forgetting to wear it and missing data. In contrast, the Leaf is designed to fit right into my active lifestyle with no interruptions.

2016-11-23,"My search for an activity tracker I will actually wear ended with the Bellabeat Leaf Urban. Tracking motivates me to set aside time to exercise, and to walk more during the day. My Leaf fits around my neck, on my wrist or in my pocket, where my phone would never fit. Every time I wear it, I get compliments, and everyone is amazed that this stylish piece of jewelry has a purpose. Sleep tracking has helped show me I’m not getting as much sleep as I thought, prodding me to make bedtime routine changes. It’s been a tool for me!","Pretty, easy to wear, and motivates!",5
2017-01-05,"I should have purchased this off Amazon, due to the time I had to wait to get from the manufacturer. I paid for it on their website, and 4 weeks later, got it. I got this after my Fitbit died after an accidental shower. I wasn't too heartbroken, Fitbits are easy to use, and I learned a lot about myself and my activity level with it, but it was starting to come apart and I wanted something prettier. I also suffer from migraines, so it's claims for stress and period tracking appealed to me.Firstly, it's beautiful. I like that about it. But it's awkward to place. I wanted to wear it as a bracelet, but I have a 7.5"" wrist, and the band didn't fit. Didn't even come close to fitting. So I wore it like a necklace. But the chain rubbed against the metal, and always made an annoying ""ZZZZZZZZZZZ"" sound when I moved. I tried to clip it to pants, but like another reviewer, it came off when I was going to the bathroom. So I'm left with clipping it to my shirt collar or bra.For it's ""stress"" claims and it's monitoring, all it does is show you that if you don't move, you'll be stressed. Not helpful. Part of the reason I purchased this was so I could become more aware of my stress, so I could track my migraines in accordance. Wrong.For period tracking, I love this. I practice NFP due to my reactions to birth control, and this helps tremendously.Now, activity level. I notice that it tracks fewer steps, doesn't track bike rides automatically at all, or any other type of strenuous activity. Fitbit tracked yoga automatically, as well-this doesn't have a clue.And it's ""meditation"" is just a body scan. It tells you to relax, and a (rather pleasant-not annoying)voice guides you through relaxation. But... if you do it on your own, this device doesn't track or sense it, and there's no place to input it.The claims and press this got for being able to ""sense"" things about you are why I got this, and I should have stuck with a fitbitHR for all my tracking needs. And if you're just going to have a pedometer​ attached to an app, I expect the app to have more thrown in. A meal tracker, maybe?So if you want a glorified pedometer, with a few extra programs thrown in for period tracking and meditation, this is for you.",Glorified Pedometer,2
2017-01-17,"I received the leaf urban as a Christmas gift. I wanted something that didn't look like an activity tracker. I have found it very easy to use, durable, and really cute. I have only worn it as a bracelet at this point. I saw other reviewers comment on the bracelet coming apart, I have not had that problem at all. It has even been easy to sleep in with no irritation. The app is user-friendly and has available meditations which really makes it easy to take advantage of. I'm very pleased and would recommend it to anyone!",So far So good!,5
2017-01-24,"My husband got me a Leaf Urban for Christmas after watching me covet them for months, and I was so excited to get it!! It works well in conjunction with my Apple Watch and Health apps. I do have to remember to update what way I am wearing it, sometimes I wear the necklace at bedtime, and sometimes I wear the bracelet. As long as I remember to update this, it has been very accurate. Looking forward to more reproductive info on updates, maybe pertaining to menopause, though. Love the guided Meditations. And it's a cute accessory to boot!",Love it!!,5
2017-01-06,This has been so easy to use and fantastic at tracking everything!  I sync twice a day.  I'm mostly interested in how it says I sleep at night and then my steps count at the end of the day.  I do also love that it tracks my stress and menstrual cycle.  I LOVE IT!  And have worn it every day since I've gotten it.  I like that it lets you add an activity.  I teach and do both heated and non-heated yoga.

The tracker is pretty accurate too. I compared it to my husband's Fitbit one day when we were walking together, and it was very close. I wear it as a bracelet or necklace during the day and as a clip-on at night. The bracelet could be a little easier to put on, but I like the way it looks. I'm planning to make my own when I have a chance. Etsy also has a lot of replacement bracelets for it. The  app is also easy to use.",I love my Bellabeat Leaf Urban,5

I honestly expected that form would win over function, but it works as well as it looks.It tracks steps and sleep patterns well, and allows you to log heaps of other activities.  You can also set your own goals, and change them.I quite like the built in meditation guides, though I'm less a fan of the breathing exercises.  I do wish I could log my own meditation, outside of the ones done through the app and tracker.I'm a fan :)",I'm having my cake AND eating it!!,5
2016-11-09,I have been using the Urban for several months and am very pleased with it. It is a lovely piece of jewelry and clips snugly onto my shirts if I don't wear it on the wrist strap.  It is very accurate recording steps. There is a wide variety of activities to choose from and there are more being added. Bellabeat are very responsive to inquiry's and suggestions. The guided meditations are very helpful and the sleep record has been very interesting.  I wanted something to help me plan my activity after a total knee replacement and the Urban has been perfect for this.,Bellabeat Urban fits my lifestyle!,5
2017-01-12,"I have had my Leaf Urban since Christmas, but previously had a Leaf Nature for a year. I LOVE my Leaf Nature. While I do not dislike the Leaf Urban, I have found that it is a bit more difficult to wear as a clip due it it's design. I was also quite disappointed to learn that, while it is water resistant, you cannot swim with it. As a lifeguard, the water resistant advertisement was what made me really want to upgrade to the Leaf so that I could wear it around the pool without worry. I was disappointed to open the box and read that it was only splash resistant and not truly water resistant. I also wish that the Leaf Urban had more differences from the Nature. The only ""upgrade"" I see is the splash resistance. There is no other new feature between it and the Nature.As another reviewer said, I wish the app allowed you to input your actual distance walked/biked etc. The Leaf app calculates your distance estimation based on your height. I have walked using a gps tracker on my phone and calculated a 2 mile walk, and the Leaf app estimates that I walked only 1.2 miles based on my height. I made the suggested change to the developers over 6 months ago and got a response back saying they would consider it, but it has not been released in an app update as of yet.I still really love my Leaf, despite these minor quirks, and have recommended it to many people. Obviously, new updates will continue and hopefully more improvements will be made.",Wish the Urban did more things differently than the Nature,4
2016-12-20,"I've had my Leaf a couple of months now, and I love it! I've been complemented more than once as it's so beautiful, and using the app has helped me monitor my sleep patterns, activity and log meditations and relaxation too. As a tandem-breastfeeding mum of two, I *love* that breastfeeding counts as an activity, and that I can see how many calories I've expended by doing it! Each update to the app has proved really helpful (most recently, being able to log my own meditations rather than just relying on the in-app ones), and updates come regularly so I trust that it will continue to improve and grow.",Love it!,5

It seems fairly accurate, comparable to the fitbit I used to use.",I LOVE that this fitness / step tracker looks so beautiful ...,5
2017-09-04,"I've had the Urban leaf for a month now, and I've been mostly pleased with it. I'm not really a fitness tracker person because I can get too wrapped up in the numbers. However, I love that this only displays your stats when you sync your device, so I don't feel compelled to look at my step count constantly.The features are nice and well thought out, though I haven't made meditation a habit yet.It is beautiful, especially the rose gold and black leaf with the black leather bracelet. It looks cool enough that my boss (a guy in his mid-40's who low-key mocks everyone's FitBits) was telling our co-workers, ""And look, her necklace is actually a fitness tracker! It doesn't look like one at all!""I took a star away because I've already had trouble getting it to sync for a day, which ended up being resolved by taking off the back plate and making sure the battery was settled properly, but it still lost a day of data. Not a huge deal, but I'm concerned bit might happen more often. Will update this review with any issues.Overall, I really do love it, and hope it keeps working for a long time!",Beautiful fitness tracker,4
2017-01-23,So the leather bracelet is so comfortable and easy to get on and off. I love the clip functionality too. I get so many compliments about it.I love the guided breathing sessions... and the meditation sessions.

2017-01-24,"This fancy piece of smart jewelry was on my wish list for almost a year, and I am excited to say it has finally appeared! I, like you, did my research, watched the promo videos, and whistfully watched the instagram photos wishing I could model the bracelet once and for all. So I'll spare you how excited I was to get it and share the nitty gritty details. Starting from the beginning, it shipped relatively quickly. Once I received it, I was more impressed than I thought I would be with the quality of the items that came with it. Think of it as a 3-in-one because it comes with a really pretty rose gold necklace, leather bracelet, and of course you can wear it as just the piece itself. I typically don't wear it as a necklace because it is bigger than I would actually want it to be as a necklace. I'm a dainty person, so I have my limits. I do often wear it when I'm sleeping as a bracelet or by itself on my sleeping shorts. It does just fine. Also, it has a battery that lasts 6 months! I can barely remember to charge my phone, so this is a wonderful feature. It came with a cute little screwdriver that I suppose I will have to use eventually, but I am so happy to not have to worry about it. My tracker tracks my sleep and steps, although it does seem to exaggerate how many steps I've taken (I also have an app on my phone) But I often leave my phone places when I am walking (unintentionally) so maybe that's why. It has this cute option to vibrate with three different time settings. I set it to be times like when I should be done eating lunch and when I should be getting ready for bed. Lastly, it has these cool meditations you listen to on your phone and actually work for me, so I would recommend doing that once you get this thing. For the cons because this wouldn't be a review without one: I do sometimes have trouble with the bracelet. It is a little difficult to put on by yourself and sometimes it can fall off, but you would notice. It's not too heavy of a weight, but it is noticeable if it comes off, so don't worry about that. The other con is that I'm not sure honestly how well the sleep or walking tracker works. I'm sure it is fine, but I haven't done any comparison studies to really know. I think it is relatively accurate, and that's all I care about. It makes me more active and it's really pretty, so that is what I was looking for out of the product and it over delivered.",Health Tracker with Flair,5
2018-01-17,"Absolutely love my leaf!  Not only does it help me keep track of steps, sleep, hydration etcetra it is so pretty!  I get complements all the time on my beautiful bracelet, little do they know it is also my health tracker!😍",I love my Urban!,5
2017-01-23,I got my Leaf as a Christmas gift and it has really helped me to focus on my health. I knew I wasn't getting enough sleep or exercise but since using the Leaf I have felt more motivated as I can see the changes I am trying to make pay off. I was also a little concerned about my cycle as I have an IUD and now I know what is happening with my body too! I was wearing it as a necklace but prefer the look as a bracelet as it's so pretty. It hasn't yet fallen off and always feels secure. If it could improve I wonder if a diet tracker would help but so far I love it as it is!,Love it,5
2017-01-13,"I bought this tracker mainly because it looks like a modern piece a jewelry, so I figured that I could still use it even if it did not work. The tracker itself is beautiful, and light enough you forget you are wearing it if you clip it to your shirt. The necklace is very good quality, but I am not impressed by the bracelet's band. it looks flimsy and cheap. Still, it comes with all this accessories, and tools to replace the cell battery.As for functionality, I have only used it for less than a month, but here are my thoughts:1) the app did not download on my ipad, in fact it did not show up in the app store, even when I tried using the link from the site. I do have an Android phone and it worked fine there. However, when I first downloaded, the app did not really work, find my leaf or sync till I downloaded the suggested update.2) the sync function is pretty confusing at first. It mentions tapping your device, once, then twice, then once, and I was not sure if they meant the actual Leaf tracker or the leaf icon...and I noticed that it is not necessary. After initial sync, now it seems to be syncing fine.3) As for the tracker, it is a little weak, as far as functionality is concerned. I am still confused by how it tracks walking, and what counts. It definitively does not count all your steps like Google fit does. So, housework, or basic walking will not count. Fortunately you can add in your own activity, but you would expect a tracker to do it for you.4) also, there is no difference between walking or hiking, as in many trackers, so you would have to adjust it.5) I like the sleep tracker, and the fact you can adjust it. It is hard to say how accurate it is, but it did detect my waking up time6) I have never used the meditation tool, but I like that the apps comes with many different guided meditations you can use7) the app also have a period tracking function, but I do not use itSo, my overall opinion: if you need a very accurate tracker, with multiple setting, and fine tuning, probably the Leaf is not for you. However, if you need a tool to help you stay on track with a healthier lifestyle, and you want to look beautiful while doing it, this is the tracker for you. Plus remember, if the tracker breaks, you are still left with a gorgeous pendant!","Very stylish, but not for athletes",3

I don't sleep enough most of the time and it's already helped me to keep track and be more aware of my sleep needs.The leaf is a little more bulky than I thought it would be, but it's beautiful and light, I wear it all the time.",Brilliant motivator and tracking tool,5

I wanted to track my steps, but didn't want my tracker to get aggressive when I wasn't stepping enough, you know?

2017-01-12,"I received the leaf urban as a gift. I really like the look of it and have had many compliments on it. It seems to track my steps and sleep very well. I am quite happy with it.I wanted to update my review with a pro and a con:Con: My leaf fell off and I looked everywhere but could not find it. I was quite upset because it was a gift from my teenage boys who for the first time ever actually got me something thoughtful! It is a con because the clip did not hold as well as it should. The clip gets bent too far open very easily and will not hold tightly until bent back into shape.Pro: A a week later, after several days of rain, ice and snow, I was cleaning downed branches from my yard and there in the middle of the yard was my leaf!I figured it was now just a piece of jewelry but to my surprise, it paired right away with my phone and has been working well.Not only is it pretty, it is also tough!I would like to add to my review after using the leaf for about 6 months. It is a good step counter, other than that, I do not see much function. I work overnight and sleep during the day. It doesn't detect my daytime sleep even though I wear it clipped on my shirt as recommended. Every morning after work it asks me if I slept. After waking in the afternoon I have to manually enter my sleep time which is silly.  The stress calculation is also not really accurate. It bases your stress on sleep, exercise and meditation. I am very active and rarely sit down so I usually have hours of activity, I never mediate and miss sleep at least  4 or 5 days per month due to my family commitments. The fact that I move so much seems to negate my lack of sleep.My overall feeling about the leaf now is that it is a nice looking step counter but not much more.",I really like the look of it and have had many compliments ...,2

2019-06-19,"My bellabeat Leaf stopped working within 6 months of purchasing it. Given the 1-year warranty, I reached out to customer service and they walked me through some troubleshooting steps, including changing the battery. This did not work, and I went back and forth with their team over the course of several weeks. They had me try everything, opening up the leaf many times, to no avail. I am very disappointed they don't have more proactive customer service that is willing to honor the warranty when my device was obviously defective. I can't recommend it.",Stopped Working Within 6 Months-One Year Warranty Not Honored,1
2017-01-28,"Posted on my boyfriends Amazon account, because I had to share that I absolutely love my BellaBeat and how its helped me improve my everyday life style.Best for: women who are slowly trying to better their daily lifestyle habits (like me!)Not for: Intense fitness junkies who want their intense workouts and cardio tracked automaticallyFavorite Features:*The in-app meditation! I've never meditated in my entire life and probably would not have known where to even start, or even thought of trying it. I now regularly use during my commute to work, and nights when I struggle to fall asleep. Sure enough, after my 10 minutes I am fast asleep!*Period Tracker - I've always told myself I need to stop tracking this and I never did. Now I can track with a touch of a screen, and it gives me a nice heads up when the time is nearing*Sleep tracker - I've read a few reviews griping that this is not accurate. So far, aside from a few occasional nights it has been pretty spot on for me. I am always oddly proud when my Deep Sleep is in the 45% range. I am the queen of sleeping!*Activity tracker is probably the weakest feature on this tracker, compared to other health trackers that probably better estimate your daily exercise. However, the other features are enough for me to purchase. I see the activity features not as a main feature, but an extra feature that is a really big motivator for me to get off my butt and move! I set a goal for at least an hour of exercise (their definition of activity is extremely relative) a day. It's motivated me to get into a better habit from completely immobile after work to doing pilate workout videos 6 days out of the week.*Another + feature for the activity tracker is you can manually input your own exercise and their categories are vast and also includes activities specially for women.  (ie; breastfeeding, heck yeah that should be included!)The wearing options for the Bellabeat are a necklace chain, leather bracelet, and clip which are all included in the packaging. I personally love the leather bracelet and only take it off to shower. The smallest hole fits my wrist perfectly and in the past 2 months, it has only fallen off twice in my sleep. I would use the clip more regularly but it is SO FREAKING HARD to get open. The clip is probably my biggest complaint about the Bellabeat....,if I HAD to pick one thing to dislike :)Although the stress indicator is completely questionable, it does help me stay aware of my own moodiness, and just motivates me to better my lifestyle when the stress level is higher than usual by improving my day with meditation, more sleep, or exercise.I think this would make a great gift for a lazy friend, partner, sister, mother who you really want to push to start bettering their lifestyle. It's pretty to wear and is not as intimidating for the receiver and does not come off as judgemental as giving someone an fitness tracker like a fitbit. I know, because I was that lazy friend who unknowingly needed this in my life.",Has promoted better living habits,5
2019-12-24,"Let me just say, I was so excited about getting the Bellabeat. I was excited to have a fitness/health tracker that looked beautiful and could be worn multiple ways. As a chef, I can't have anything on my wrist, so I was excited I could wear it as a necklace under my shirt or even clip it to an undershirt to wear. I got my first one in June and it worked great for about 3 months before it suddenly quit syncing. I spent a month going back and forth with the Bellabeat tech support trying to troubleshoot what was wrong with the device before they sent me a new one. I received the new one, and after not even a month, the battery was completely drained (it's suppose to last 6 months mind you, and that one came directly from the company, not amazon). After contacting their tech support, again, and having to purchase another new battery (because of course I tried changing the battery before contacting tech support), only to discover that the device drained the brand new battery in a single day. You can see in the picture which I received from the company the time lapse of the battery life. Of course after this the offered to send me yet another new Bellabeat, but at this point, I am very annoyed with the company and disappointed in the product and will never purchase another bellabeat product again.","There are better products, don't get this one",2
2017-01-02,"I had another health tracker but it never quite worked properly, was too sporty looking and died after a year.I was intrigued by the BellaBeat because of its diversity in wearing, it's beauty but especially it's health tracking. I can't believe it, but the meditations are actually working! Monitoring my health holistically with this device is already having an effect. I also like that I don't have to sync and charge it with a computer, just my phone app. Awesome.",Goes with and does everything,5
2016-12-23,"I am in love with my leaf urban! I've wanted a fitness tracker for a while but I was not liking the idea of having something ugly on my wrist all the time. I love how beautiful the leaf is, and versatile! My only complaint that I can think of is that I cannot input my own meditation time from yoga class, as it only counts time from the meditations in the actual app.",In love!!!,5
2017-01-23,"I like the Leaf Urban with a couple of qualifications. First the wrist band is very difficult to wrap and buckle, although very attractive when on. Second the clip is so tight I broke a thumbnail trying to get it on my undershirt for use in bed. Other than those two complaints I find it very accurate in recording sleep and steps. I enjoy the guided meditations. I'm not sure how the calculate the ""stress resistance,"" part of the dashboard but find it interesting to track. I'm past menopause and am not using the cycle tracking option. The inactivity warnings seem to come at very odd times, (Like while brushing my teeth) so I'm not sure they are helpful at all. I feel like it's a little bit pricey for what you get but that's just me. My son has an Apple Watch that seems to do a whole lot more, but it's ugly and even more pricey, so there you have it.",Nice and attractive,4
2016-12-29,"I was looking to replace an aging FitBit and wanted something different. I liked how this would combine several of the apps i already used (Fitbit and PinkPad) into one app. So I ordered.First of all, the unit itself is very nice. It is sleek and well designed, quite stylish if you're wearing your fitness tracker visibly. The Leaf certainly has more aesthetic appeal than a FitBit. However, the unit is large, quite large in fact. When wearing it as a necklace, it is very quickly a Statement piece instead of just an accent. As a bracelet, it has the heft of a watch and i kept trying to look at it to see the time. I tend to wear it clipped to my bra instead.The bracelet attachment is not terrible secure; while i haven't had the unit pop out of the bracelet during wear, actually getting it on while keeping the bracelet straps attached to the unit is difficult and cumbersome. i'm also not a giant fan of the double-wrap of the strap, but that's a personal preference more than anything.As a necklace it's semi-okay, however the unit tends to stick to my skin very uncomfortably. Again, this is probably something specific to me, but if you have semi-oily skin, it is something to be aware of.I haven't noticed my steps/milage to be off, i haven't tracked it very closely in the past. It will judge your activity based on time spent as opposed to actual steps which is an interesting thing to me. The place i had the biggest problem was a place like Disneyland where i spent a lot of time walking around, but due to the pace, my Fitbit wouldn't always judge ""active"" minutes correctly. i haven't taken my Leaf to Disneyland yet, so I'm not sure how it will perform on that scale.The menstrual tracking is completely manual, but is on par with PinkPad which i was using before.The sleep part causes me a bit of frustration. i do like the fact that i don't have to tell it when i go to bed; i was constantly forgetting to tell my Fitbit i was going to bed, or that i was waking up. The Leaf just predicts that you're in bed based on activity level. i generally sync mine when i wake up, so it knows when i've woken up. The problem is, any non-activity after about 9pm is interpreted as ""bedtime."" So if you're a person that likes to sit still before bed (to read, to watch TV, to relax), be aware you'll probably end up having to adjust your time (and when you do that it WILL change some of the data. I got up to go to the bathroom one night, and that was reflected in my sleep data as an awake period. When i adjusted the time, that awake section was gone and replaced with ""light sleep"" which was totally wrong). The app also gets a bit snarky with you if you don't get enough sleep. While I get the humor that's supposed to be there... if i'm not sleeping well, i don't need snark from my fitness tracker. i'm grumpy enough as it is, thanks.Other than that, is is somewhat accurate, but last night was a particularly restless night, where i was waking up every hour about on the hour. Yet, my Leaf still proclaimed i got 9 hours of sleep and am looking beautifully rested. i certainly don't feel rested, and i got nowhere near 9 hours of sleep.Also, while it claims to sync to the Apple Health app, it doesn't seem to be talking to mine.One other thing with the Leaf, it does not constantly sync the way the Fitbit does. It only syncs when you tell it to. This was a little annoying at first, but I got over that pretty fast. Because these are replaceable batteries, not a rechargeable, i understand why the choice was made and am okay with it.All in all, it's fine. It's not super great. Once this one has outlived its usefulness I'll probably go back to Fitbit. But, it's a nice interlude.",It's fine. But it's not great.,3
2016-12-30,"I've had my bellabeat urban for several months now. I really am enjoying this tracker. I've had ones in the past that I used to jump start my fitness tracking but as several others have mentioned, they didn't go well with my wardrobe. I've received several comments about how pretty my ""bracelet"" is and when I tell them that it's a fitness tracker, they are quite impressed.So regarding its performance, I'm using it mainly to track my sleep patterns, meditation and periods. The fitness aspects are nice but not very complex as are other fitness trackers. The sleep tracker works great. The period tracker is good to remind me that it's coming and if I'm on schedule. It'll be great at my next obgyn appt.The band for the bracelet is nice and delicate and I love the look. The hooks will come undone if you don't wear it tightly. But it's supposed to be tight to work properly anyway.For activities, please add martial arts in the list.",Beautiful,4

I didn't think it would, but it has actually made me more accountable, encouraging me to ensure I reach my daily step count and get adequate rest to balance out my day.I'm a huge fan of the recorded meditations, when I find the time to commit to them.

2016-12-20,"Overall I love this product. It's cute, and I love that it tracks sleep, menstrual cycle, meditation, and activity; it even predicts stress levels.I don't have a FitBit, so I can't compare to that, but I would say the only downsides are as follows:when worn as a necklace, the step counting does not seem to be entirely accurate, nor does it always seem to be accurate if worn clipped onto pants pockets.When worn as a bracelet, it is super easy to lose, as it falls off very easily (clips are fairly open-ended). Most days I clip it to the top of my shirt or the waist of my pants and it seems to be fairly accurate.Occasionally, it doesn't seem to record if I have woken up during the night, but more often than not it seems to be accurate with regard to deep and restless sleep. It's usually spot-on with the times I've gone to sleep and woken up.It took months for the Bellabeat to arrive, but I was ok with that; it felt like it was less mass-produced than other products on the market. In addition, Bellabeat provides consistent and friendly communications. They really make you feel like they care! Customer service is fantastic. I asked them a question via Facebook and heard back within a few hours.As a yogi, I love not only the design of this product, but the fact that you can input activities like yoga and meditation. It also comes with recorded meditations and it does very well with tracking your breathing to see just how meditative you were!It's water-resistant so it can be splashed, but should not be submerged. I accidentally wore it in the shower one day and was super worried I ruined it, but it still works beautifully! (Still don't recommend wearing it in the shower, though).",Pros and Cons; Overall wonderful product!,4
2016-11-29,"Obviously the Leaf Urban is gorgeous. It has stayed on and looked great for months now. Haven't put the water resistance to the test because I'm a wuss, but we'll see what happens when I do.I switched to this brand from Fitbit because this marketed itself as able to synch with Healthkit on iOS. Considering I already track many of the same things as the Leaf on separate apps, being able to have them synchronize without a bridge app like Fitbit needs (they've said they never intend to fully integrate into iOS, so third party apps cross the gap) was really attractive so I could have things like symptom data all together and most importantly BACKED UP on Healthkit.So I switched to Bellabeat and it turns out I can only synchronize steps. Never mind that Healthkit can import menstrual data, mindfulness data, exercise data, and sleep data. Bellabeat just doesn't send it. As a chronic migraine sufferer, I actually do need to collate those things. Women need more than the prettiest tracker. Our chronic conditions matter. Being deceptive about what we'll be able to do for ourselves with this data is far beneath Bellabeat's potential.And here is another issue. If you keep a second or third shift schedule you WILL be inputting your sleep manually much of the time. You will be better off with a tracker you can clock in and out of than one that only auto-detects sleep which begins between 2100-0900.This was a really poorly marketed and poorly described product. All hype and no specifics. I am the one who took the risk. So okay. Lesson learned. A lot of these are software fixes though, I think. So if they get fixed, let me know, and I'll revise this review.","Very pretty, software too proprietary. Third shifters should skip entirely.",2

2016-11-23,I originally looked into the Leaf because I had options other than to wear it on my wrist. I have larger wrists and often feel claustrophobic when wearing things like bracelets or watches. I knew someone that had one and they really liked it so I ordered mine. I love it. It made me realize how sedentary I was in my job. Now I work towards getting more steps in each day. I really love the guided meditations in the app too! This is a quality product and I'm so excited to continue to use it.,Love my Leaf Urban!,5
2017-01-20,"I had mine for two weeks and it stopped syncing to the app all of a sudden. My problem was that support was exclusively online and the only suggestion to my first inquiry was to unscrew the back and take out the battery to reset it. The issue with this was the screws were tiny.  I had the eyeglasses tools to open it, but the screws on my Bella Beat just kept turning, never loosened and the back never came off. This was very frustrating as it was a warning sign to me that I'd have more issues with this item down the road when the battery needed to be changed. I'd also asked for tech support assistance and no one from that department every follow-ed up. I liked it for the brief time that I had it, but having so many issues with it in the first month was too much. I asked for a return and they returned my money and disabled it and told me to keep it as jewelry. I was very disappointed as I researched this a lot and had high hopes. I also found the 72 hour response time to any inquiry a little disappointing as well.",I liked it for the brief time that I had it,2
2020-04-24,"Support is only via e-mail and takes days to turn around a suggestion...  until you're out of warranty and then tough luck.The tracker is not accurate (I manually counted my steps) and has completely stopped functioning and lost days of steps.  They could find nothing wrong, even though it happened multiple times and they refused to exchange the unit for another one.  They finally blamed it on syncing to both iPhone and iPad - but I stopped doing that and it happened again - twice.  I am now out $257 and they could not care less about having an unhappy customer.Too bad - 'cause the device was beautiful.",Does not work properly and company will not stand behind their product,1
2017-05-03,"I love the rose gold Leaf Urban. I use it primarily as I'd use a Fitbit, for daily step and activity tracking, but I also love the sleep and stress tracking features as well. I typically choose to wear the Leaf as a bracelet, and have received many compliments on the style and design every single time that I have worn it. I really love that it also clips directly onto your clothes alternatively, if you are working out or don't want to wear a bracelet. One thing I would caution with the bracelet, is that it can easily fall off the hooks if you have not tightened the band enough. With the proper adjustments, I haven't had this problem anymore using a tighter band setting.The app is user friendly and works well for my purposes. If you are looking for a more advanced, sporty health tracker, with heart-rate or more detailed information, this is probably not going to be as helpful to you as the Leaf only tracks more basic step activity. However, you can manually enter other activities into the app as well, if you prefer.Overall, I would highly recommend this product to any of my female friends or family for daily use. It really looks and feels like a piece of jewelry and is so much nicer looking than some of the clunky trackers available.","Beautiful design, works well for everyday use.",5
2017-05-07,"I’ve had other fitness trackers , but what I found is every time the battery died (which was about after 4-5 days of constant usage) with busy 80hour work weeks, I would forget to charge it then weeks would go by before I did and started wearing it consistently again. What I like about the bellabeat is: you don't have to charge it, the battery life lasts however long (I think around 6 months the box said) and then you replace the battery. Additionally, it looks great so I have no problem leaving it on all the time; for nice dinners, going out to events and at a professional job. It also isn't bulky like other fitness trackers so its comfortable to sleep with so you can get your sleep data. As someone who wasn't really into meditation, I like that it has a lot of various short and longer meditations available to you right on the app! I have used these a few times and really enjoy them. Easy 2 min ones and breathing exercises which are perfect for just a quick break and de-stressor. I like the flexibilty of how you can wear it. Parts of my profession require no jewelry on the hands or wrists to be worn, so its perfect during those times to just clip it to my shirt or bra. The syncing is really easy, only once did it not record my steps but that seemed to be a one off things, and I haven't had issues since. Overall I really enjoy my bellabeat and would recommend it.",Really enjoy the bellabeat!,5
2017-01-21,"I have only been using the Urban Leaf for one week, so this review may not be as comprehensive. That being said, my initial impression was that it was very pretty but 'thick' as a piece of jewelry. It's about 1/4-3/8"" thick. I intend to wear it primarily clipped to my bra or waistband because my job requires I wear no jewelry. Clipping it to any thinned-fabric clothing is risky--it tends to slip off. I have never used an activity tracker, so it is motivating to get my steps in and keep moving. And seeing the amount of movement in sleep is interesting and has been helpful. I have used several of the downloadable meditations and they are very good. I would like it if it had a hydration tracker, and if you could add personalized activities.",New to This but Liking the Tracking Features,4

I also agree with others in that it tracks the best when worn as a bracelet. As a necklace or clipped on my clothes it doesn't track even a quarter of the steps I take compared to the bracelet.

2017-01-13,"I've been wearing the Leaf for about 3 weeks, and I love it.  The period tracking part of the app is very accurate in my case (almost eerily so), like to the exact day of my ovulation.  I only expect it to get more accurate the more cycles it tracks.  I set it to vibrate as a wakeup alarm and then again midmorning.  The wakeup vibration alarm is much calm than my normal audio alarm and eases me into the day.  The midmorning alarm is supposed to signal me to stop drinking coffee and get some water in me, and so far it has worked like a charm (I'd go all day without drinking water otherwise).  That is one thing I would like to see added to the app - the ability to set an alarm for multiple times during the day (i.e. hourly).  As it is now, the activity monitor vibrates whenever I have been inactive for a certain amount of time.  The step tracker seems to be pretty accurate --> you can indicate whether you're wearing it on your wrist, neck or clipped to your pants/shirt, and it seems like you really need to specify how you're wearing it to get the best results in step #s.  Sleep tracker seems to be pretty accurate so far.  It is so much more attractive than the other types of activity trackers - I don't think I could wear a Fitbit after making this a part of my wardrobe now.  I also don't think I could switch to a chargable-type tracker.  This one has an internal ""watch"" battery that lasts 6 months.

2018-03-22,"My husband got me the Bellabeat Leaf Urban for Christmas and I was excited to have a way to track steps, sleep, etc other than with a phone app. While there are some things I do like, such as the versatility of how you can wear it, customizable goals, etc, it's fallen short of my expectations on more than one occasion. First, the device stopped accurately tracking steps and sleep (I think I'd know if I woke up at 3am...) and to top it off, there's no way to correct the errors. So, because I don't sync the device every ten minutes, I can kiss goodbye knowing how many steps I took all day, which is kind of the point of me wearing it. Also, it will randomly stop tracking anything and when I contact customer service, they've literally told me to take out the battery, put it back in, and wait two weeks. Ugh. Not my idea of technical support. Once I did that the first time, it stopped giving me the inactivity buzzes, so that feature went out the window. I know part of their advertising is that you don't have to charge it since it has a battery, but I HATE buying the small chip batteries and trying to tediously put them in. The last frustration is the wristband...I get that it's trying to be feminine and hip, but holy cow, it shouldn't take using my teeth or asking my kids for help to put it on. They definitely chose form over function on that design. All in all, it's okay but I don't know if I'd highly recommend it since more than once, it's failed to do what it should.","While there are some things I do like, such as the versatility of how you can ...",3

My favorite feature is that it syncs with the Google Fit app I was already using before I made this purchase! 😃 Oh, and I opted for the Urban Lead Version because it is water resistant, unlike the Natural Leaf.The only negative so far is it doesn't sync automatically, you tap your leaf to activate the sync.

A win-win purchase.",Leaf-My healthy lifestyle coach!,5
2016-11-11,"I love my Bellabeat! I had a Fitbit before and I have an incline trainer so when I held on while walking it wouldn't record my steps accurately. This tracker is so versatile it can be worn clipped on your clothes, as a necklace, or as a bracelet. I really like that. I also don't have to charge it every few days because it runs on a watch battery.",Awesome!,5
2017-01-24,My 21 year old son bought me a leaf for Christmas.  I love it. I now monitor my activity and sleep daily. I've never paid attention to my sleep and was often sick due to never catching up. I also make myself move a bit more when I get sluggish. I love this product. Everyone thinks I have a new really great bracelet!,Love it!,5
2017-01-19,"I love my Bellabeat! The best part is it looks like a nice piece of jewelry and not a fitness contraption. I can wear it anywhere with any outfit, and have rarely taken it off since receiving it as a Christmas gift.  The sleep tracking is my favorite part and it is usually spot on with how I feel I slept the night prior.  I'm new to meditation so the basics included in the app are perfect for me trying to learn to be more mindful. It is water resistant, so you cannot wear it in the shower or swimming, but I haven't had any issues with my frequent hand washing or doing dishes.I do have a few minor critiques that have to do more with the accessories and the app.  The one bracelet that comes with it does not match the Bellabeat itself.  I wish it was black or gray not only to match but because  the beige color is already showing wear and tear after daily wear for a month. Also, I wish the app included a place to track daily water intake so I could do this all in one place.",Stylish and Functional,4
2016-12-14,Love my leaf urban! I've had numerous people ask me about it because they like the style. It has accurate tracking compared to other brands I have tried.,Love my leaf urban,5
2016-12-22,"This truly is a beautiful accessory. If you are using it to track cycles and plan pregnancy it works great. It however lacks a little on the step tracking and calorie monitoring. It would be nice to have heart rate monitors, automatic sync and time feature. The sleep tracking seems to run fairly accurate however I found it records the best as a watch not as the clip on, which is recommended. The necklace feature is also not that accurate in regards to steps but very pretty to wear. I love the alarm capability however doesn't always work right so don't use as your sole alarm. Overall for what is use it for it works great and I love it.",Beautiful bracelet,4
2017-06-26,"I love my leaf. I didn't want one of those device-looking trackers that pushes you with so called positive feedback. It doesn't motivate me. The leaf doesn't bother me with any updates. I have wake up alarm on my leaf, so pleasent to wake up this way. I usually have it on as a bracelet, but great with 3 options to wear the leaf. It tracks my day very well. I have yet to try out the meditation lessons.",Love the leaf,5
2017-01-25,My husband bought this as a Christmas present to replace my broken fitbit. I love the versatility of this fitness tracker. I really like that I can wear it different ways depending on the day. The fitness tracker itself seems pretty accurate. I enjoy the simplicity of the app. I only wish it was easier to sync with other apps (such as my fitness pal).I am extremely happy with my Bellabeat.,Stylish and accurate,5
2017-01-20,"I've been looking at this for a long time. I didn't like the look of a Fitbit and Apple watches just seemed huge and utilitarian. I really like the way this looks and it was easy to set up. The app is pretty straight forward and useful - I just want to track my activity, be reminded to take it easy, and track sleep. The one thing that isn't stellar about the app is the period tracker. I already have a much better app for that, so I probably won't use that function. The leather for the bracelet is a little flimsy and I don't necessarily like the cappuccino color, so I may look for a different bracelet, which is how I want to wear it most of the time.So far I'm pleased.",Does exactly what it says it will,4
2017-01-20,"I consistently get compliments on my Leaf, which I wear as a necklace.  I've found the sleep tracker to be accurate and helpful.  I also enjoy the meditation feature.  It's a beautiful and helpful health tracker.  My only minor complaint is that the bracelet is small and did not fit comfortably on my wrist.  But this was minor as I prefer to clip it on or wear it as a necklace.",I also enjoy the meditation feature,5
2016-11-21,"I saw this after purchasing & wearing a Garmin & liked how this looked so much better & more like a piece of jewelry.  I usually wear it as a bracelet, but have also worn it  as a necklace & clipped to my shirt. Love it & have received several compliments on it.",Urban leaf,5
2016-12-20,"I love my Bellabeat! It works great and I love everything it can do. I use the meditation feature and enjoy the pre-loaded meditations. It tracks my steps accurately.

A wonderful fitness tracker geared towards ladies that can do so much more.",I love my Bellabeat,5
2016-11-23,"Love my newest Bellabeat Leaf Urban.  I purchased the first one a couple of years ago.  Loved that one as well, but when I seen that the Urban was water resistant, I jumped on the opportunity to purchase one.  I do a lot of hand washing dishes and to have to take the Leaf off and replace it somewhere else is somewhat a nuisance.  Love how both tracks everything and looks like a piece of jewelry and not a fitness band.",HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!,5
2017-03-30,"I love my Leaf Urban to bits. It's so pretty and it's a constant reminder for me to be more allert and mindful. After having been a triathlete for many years, always striving for faster, better and more, the Bellabeat Leaf Urban helps me to be kinder and gentler to myself. Keeping fit but not torturing myself any longer with huge amount of training. I start to feel what my body really needs and wants.Thanks for this gorgeous reminder!",Thanks for this gorgeous reminder!,5
2019-02-20,"I got this for Valentine's Day and had problems syncing from the beginning. I had issues getting it to connect to the app, which crashed a lot. The step counter was awful and always off. I finally got fed up and returned it. Sad because a lot of people complimented me on how pretty it is.",Pretty tracker but pretty awful,1
2016-12-15,"It's beautiful. Hands down it is the most versatile activity tracker. Can be worn as a necklace, bracket or clips onto clothing. The urban states it is water resistant, and I would have to agree. I don't bother taking it off in the shower. It's nice to have the stress tracking but I question it's methodology. Tracking the menstrual cycle is also an added benefit.I would like to see the software improved.currently all meditations are guided. I understand that For alot of people this is a value add for me the whole point of meditation is to get the voices out of my head. If meditation sessions could have a silent timer or ability to manually enter the times that would be great.",Works well for me but Software could use some help,4
2016-12-29,"I am really enjoying my bellabeat. I like how stylish it is!! It doesn't scream activity monitor!  I really enjoy seeing the all of the helpful information (activity, sleep, stress) right on the app!  It helps keep me motivated and conscious of my progress! Also excited to know that they are always looking to improve and make it even better!!",Fun and stylish health tracker,5
2017-01-25,I have the rose gold edition and it is SO CUTE! I got it for Christmas and I would've never guessed it could do everything it does! The app is super easy to navigate and it fits very comfortably on my wrist! The only thing is that is very difficult to put on by yourself - so you'll need someone to help you! But that's with any piece of jewelry that goes on your wrist. I'd buy the bellabeat over and over with no hesitations! Love love love!,What an amazing gift!,5
2016-12-14,I love my leaf. I get compliments on how. Use it looks and then people are surprised when I tell them it is a wellness tracker. I really like the free meditations. The menstral tracker is a little off but I like it. It helps me stay aware of my sleep schedule and the amount of activity each day.,Great for working moms,5
2016-12-13,"Have been using the Bellabeat Leaf Urban now for about 2 months, and love it! I've lost a few pounds being more aware of my movement. The sleep tracker is nice as well. My favorite feature though is the Stress awareness. It really helps me maintain balance in my life. The meditation options are great as well, and I use them often when I have a few moments and need to realign in the present. Highly recommend!","Great tool, attractive design.",5
2017-01-17,"Purchased in November as a Christmas gift as their website at the time said that it would take 4-6 weeks for the leaf to even leave their Warehouse.  Well the leaf arrived about 11 days later which would have been great except I put it under the tree as a Christmas gift.  After opening on Christmas and discovering that it wouldn't work, and spending a couple of weeks going back and forth with their customer service trying to troubleshoot,  they won't do a return since it was longer than 30 days from the time they delivered it to me. So, I'm out $139 and I'm going to have to find a replacement gift.",AWFUL PRODUCT AND SERVICE BY BELLABEAT!!,1
2017-01-19,"I received my leaf urban for Christmas complete with necklace chain and wrap for bracelet. I am loving it. The sleep tracker is most interesting to me and it is very accurate. I like the alarms you can set on it too, so it wakes me if something happens with my regular alarm and I never forget to take my meds. I like the reminder for meditation, but it only tracks it if you do one of their meditation series. I wish it could track when I do my.own deep breathing at a short break or at a stoplight. I also like tracking my activity very much, however, it is not accurate with the steps. For instance, I will run 4 miles on my treadmill and run some errands and such but it will say I only went about 3 miles ALL day. That is even if it on clipped on my undershirt, which is the most accurate reading placement. So, at least I see where I was active, where I can improve, and know I can add at least 1-2000 more steps than it reads. I love that it is an accessory piece of jewelry I enjoy wearing rather than some bulky plastic I can only keep on my wrist. Perhaps the makers could make it more sensitive to activity and add a heart rate monitor to it. That is the ONLY thing it could be missing from this fantastic health tracker. This health coach is satisfied.","Stylish, comprehensive tracker. Not perfect but better than most for sure!",4
2016-12-28,"I love the Leaf Urban! Flexibility on wearing it (bracelet, necklace, or clip) makes it easy for any wardrobe. My favorite feature is the mindfulness minutes with built in meditation choices. Fantastic integration of all your health monitoring.",I love the Leaf Urban,5

2016-12-07,It's great..I forgot to put it back on after showering and was lost without it all day.Also get a lot of compliments on such a beautiful necklace.,You will love it!!!,5
2016-12-05,"The leaf is really pretty. I have had multiple compliments on it since I started wearing it. I do feel like it lacks a little in the area of accuracy. I was intrigued by the sleep tracker and the stress tracker. The sleep one does not really track sleep vs awake time. If you are awake but stay in bed, it thinks you are still sleeping. The stress part seems completely useless. The meditations are neat but I live a pretty high stress life and it does not track that. It seems to only base stress on how much sleep, exercise and meditation you do as well as whether or not you are on your period. Good concept, poor execution. I will continue to use it but it would be nice if it were more accurate.",Pretty but not very accurate,3
2016-12-01,"I love my leaf ! I received it after 5 weeks as annonced in my order. Getting started is easy and very fast! I like to be able to add personalized goals for the number of steps, the meditation sessions, the number of hours of sleep ... Customer service is very responsive and answer all questions easily. The application is effective, clear and easy to use. Synchronization is fast. I am delighted with my purchase and recommend it.",I love my leaf,5
2017-01-31,"I bought the Urban Leaf because I wanted an activity tracker without the ugly bulk of a fit bit. It's changed my perspective on my laziness...and it has forced me off my butt. I love how it tracks my sleep too. I can review how much sleep I actually get when I have had a bad night's sleep.I get so many compliments, and so many people are blown away that it's an activity tracker. I've certainly sold a few!The only negative I have is that the battery life is supposed to last up to 6 months, and I'm currently just hitting 3 months and had to replace the battery.",Beautiful Jewelry Disguised as an Activity Tracker,4
2017-01-12,"Have been using the Leaf for less than a month and have already noticed a new incentive in my life to be active! Its also a really nice piece of jewelry and several people have commented on it since I've been wearing it. I never would wear something like a Fitbit so this is a really wonderful alternative for me. I also feel like its become a part of my daily routine - something I personally have a hard time keeping track of/just having a routine at all. Also LOVE having a more convenient period tracker. I'm so lazy about keeping track of that and end up just waiting until I see blood which is not the most sanitary, not very convenient, and a small financial burden.Sometimes the sleep tracking is finicky. For example, if I want to correct the time of a night's sleep that was a little restless and maybe I got up to go to the bathroom or something, once I adjust the sleep time, the period of time that I was awake gets retabulated as me being asleep. It's minor and doesn't really affect my overall use of the Leaf. One thing I have a larger problem with is the meditation part, it feels superfluous for people like me who are not active meditators and don't necessarily want to be (if you get the Leaf you also are buying the lifestyle that it encourages.) I would love more customizability in terms of what things matter to you, i.e. I could get rid of meditation because I just don't want to do it. Another thing I've wondered is why diet is not an option. I know that could, to a lot of people, suggest that you should be dieting in order to be fit, but I really just want another centralized way to keep track of what my body is taking in and putting out.Overall this product has benefitted me greatly and helped me get in touch with things my busy, distracted, and over-stimulated life often have led me to overlook!","YES, some things I wish could be changed but overall GREAT product",4
2017-01-11,"I had been looking at the Bella Beat Urban Leaf for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger and got it in silver. I've had it for a few weeks now and I can already tell what a difference it has made in the short time I've had it.PROS:-- Ease of use in connecting to the app-- Do not have to remove while showering-- Does not need to be charged (change the battery when it runs out -- there's a kit that comes with it)-- Fairly accurate on sleep and step tracking-- In-app guided meditations-- Cycle tracking-- Shows active and resting calories burned-- Ability to set an inactivity alert where it vibrates you if you've been inactive for however long you choose-- Gentle vibrating alarms you can set-- Stress resistance level tracking (staying at a low stress level has become a mini obsession -- it does this by calculating overall picture of health including your activity, sleep, cycle and meditation/relaxation time)-- No constant EMF radiation since it uses low power bluetooth to sync (this was a huge one for me in choosing over a fitbit, etc)-- Fairly stylish-- LightweightCONS:-- Not many additional accessories to go with it-- I've found clipping on the leaf to my clothes is somewhat of a challenge-- Wish it was a little thinnerOverall, I feel like the leaf fits in well with my lifestyle and keeps me on track and accountable for making sure I take time out of my day to focus on me. On days that I am more prone to stress I make an extra effort to be more active and meditate more. The thing I like about the Leaf is it's not just a step tracker. I'm not interested in reaching a certain number of steps per day. I'm more interested in my overall mental and physical wellbeing and the app helps me get an accurate visualization of that. Although there's always room for improvement, I am extremely happy with it. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to de-stress their life.",Really happy that I decided to purchase the Urban Leaf,4

This should be adjusted in the design.  I wore the necklace all day yesterday and it didn't record anything for me.  The first night I wore it on my wrist and it said I slept only 1 hour and 20  minutes.  It says I sleep when I am just relaxing as well, not actually sleeping.I really like the stylishness of the piece.  It is pretty.  I like the versatility---as long as the necklace works.  The app is good, easy to use.",I like this so far,4

Otherwise, it's perfect!",LOVE my birthday BELLABEAT!,5
2017-01-23,"My sister and I got the Bellabeat Leaf Urban for each other as Christmas gifts. So far I love it! I get a lot of compliments and I really like that it can be worn various ways. I use a sleep tracking app that isn't always accurate about my sleep patterns but I've found that the Leaf is actually fairly accurate most nights and I like that feature. I've only used the meditations a few times but I've liked the ones I've tried. I would love to give this tracker 5 stars however I find that it isn't always entirely accurate if I work out (easily fixed by taking a few minutes to input the info into the app) and unfortunately my biggest issue is the bracelet. I like wearing the tracker as a bracelet because I find it stylish and comfortable, however the clips that attach the bracelet to the urban are open clasps and fall off VERY easily. If they were to produce a bracelet that had clasps that closed I would be so happy!Overall I highly recommend the Leaf Urban",Almost perfect,4
2017-01-12,"Really love this product. I didn't want a large generic bracelet monitor. I work at a hospital so I can't wear things on my wrist all the time, so this suited me perfectly. I can wear as clip on or necklace while at work and then on my wrist, buy subtlety at the weekends. I like the idea of changing my strap and making it suit my outfit. The app is easy to use and monitor my activity. Really enjoying it.",Great product,5
2017-03-04,"I love the color and style of this tracker. I've had it for a couple of months now. I bought this to replace my UP24, since Jawbone doesn't make that model anymore and I don't like the looks of their new ones. I was attracted by how much this looks like jewelry. The necklace I haven't really used, but I love wearing it on the wrap bracelet or just clipping it on my clothes. The wrap bracelet took a few tries to get good at but now it's easy. If you have any dexterity issues you might find it easiest to wear it as a necklace.Features: My favorite feature is the vibration alarm clock, it's the next best thing to waking up naturally. That was the main feature that I needed in a replacement for my UP24. I think this tracker over records steps, because I wore both the Leaf Urban and UP24 together for a week or so and Leaf always reported way more steps. It's not as good at recording sleep either in my experience, it always shows less than my UP24, mostly because if I get up at night to use the bathroom it tends not to record when I go back to sleep. I was really surprised by the guided meditation courses, I have been enjoying them a lot more than I expected to.",Love the color and style of this tracker,4

I generally wear it on my wrist, and at first the strap was a bit tricky, but I've gotten the hang of it now.

2017-03-22,"I love my Bellabeat leave. I wear it all the time. To sleep and at the gym, I clip it to my shirt and other times I alternate between bracelet and necklace. It works great at the gym and tracks well. I actually like how it track better than my Apple Watch. The app is great the only thing I don't like about the app is that it cannot differentiate between deep sleep and not. Also, the bracelet strap is not secure. My leave has not fallen off but I have to make sure I have the bracelet tight enough to keep it from falling off the opening of the bracelet. I love that it shows how many calories I have burned while active and not active. I recommend this product. I'm even considering buying another one in a different color.",Urban Rose Gold,4
2016-12-20,"So disappointed after getting this for my birthday! It looks beautiful and appears well made, but the tracker is only as good as it's software, which is horrible. The step tracking is sub par and the sleep tracker is pretty much the opposite of reality (showing deep sleep when I was wide awake tossing and turning, etc). The software doesn't do anything. There is no food journal or integration with any food diary programs out there, the stress 'measurement' is just whether you have checked off the four categories (sleep, activity, meditation and where you are in your cycle), the fertility tracker doesn't record symptoms so it is just limited to counting the days. The kicker is that shipping is 4 - 6 weeks, but the return policy is only a month. So, if buying it for a gift, you risk getting it too late or giving it outside the the return policy. I found it useless after the first day of use, but can't return it because my husband played it safe and purchased it too far in advance. Customer service didn't care at all, so I can't imagine them being any help with a technical issue.",Useless,1
2018-03-14,"I have had my Bellabeat for 10 days now and I am LOVING it. I am one who doesn't enjoy walking and exercise at all. And because of my inactivity, my husband kept insisting on getting me a Fitbit, which I resisted vehemently. But then I stumbled across Bellabeat while surfing the net one night and loved what I saw and read about it. So I decided to buy one because it looked so pretty. And guess what? Since its arrival 10 days ago, I have gone from being a couch potato to walking at least 10K steps a day. My daily average in 10 days is 11,874 steps. I am so proud of myself and can already feel my tummy getting smaller. Thank you Bellabeat for getting me on the road to fitness. The only reason I gave you a 4star instead of 5 is because there is a slight inaccuracy when counting the steps (I think it is giving me around 10% more) but I have learned to adjust it and can confidently say that my current daily average is definitely reflecting the minimum daily 10K steps I have set as a goal for myself.

2017-01-02,"I bought the Leaf as an early birthday gift to myself and have been wearing it religiously for two weeks now. I wear it clipped to my shirt when I sleep and around my wrist during the day.In terms of function, it works great for capturing steps. Everything else you have to capture manually, which I don't mind unless they haven't included an activity (like push ups). Apps like Lose It! have better activity tracking for standard exercises, but Leaf has an edge on capturing non-standard movement like cooking. (Also, I appreciate the build for women, but cooking is an activity and push ups aren't? Come on now.) Sleep tracking is generally on point.In terms of overall concept, I love that ultimately you track activity, sleep, meditation, and your period in order to deduce your susceptibility to stress. That's to say, your end goal isn't about how you look, but about how you want to feel. That's a frame of mind I can get behind. The app even includes guided meditation (some soothing, some a little grating).The only thing that feels like a big miss for me is that there aren't any insights that help me pattern match. E.g. if it could give insights like ""You are more resistant to stress when you are active in the morning and at night"" or ""You are less active after nights of less sleep,"" etc.Overall, recommend. I'm hopeful for how the product can improve!",it works great for capturing steps,4

I can clip it just about anywhere.My cons are of course more prevalent:1. I can have it as a necklace or a clip on my shirt...but it is causing a skin lesion!!2. The bracelet it comes with is a joke (most ""specialty"" ones have beads, which I find chafing)3. It doesn't pick up my sleep and on the rare occasion it says I have slept...I was wide awake.4. It tracks NONE of my steps outside of my house.5. Extreme inaccuracy of the steps it does track, b/c you have to be ""active"" for 5 minutes before it counts them.  (so, sorry ladies who don't move around for 5 solid minutes at a time ALL the time, you will get little to nothing out of this).",Causing lesions and highly inaccurate.,1
2017-01-20,I really enjoy the leaf urban. It motivates me to get my steps in and it is really easy to use. You just clip it on or put it on your wrist and with the Ap you sinc it a couple times a day.  Its super easy and I get a lot of compliments about it on my wrist.,love it,5
2017-01-22,"I love that this sleep, stress, and activity tracker is designed to be a piece of jewelry. The water resistance is a really nice feature. I connected it to my Walgreens Balance Rewards card and I receive daily points for the steps my Leaf tracks. I'd love to see an iOS app update that allows a me to add notes about why I believe I didn't sleep well or how I felt during my period.",I Love the look of the Rose Gold on Black Leaf Urban!,5
2017-01-25,"I think it's a lovely design. It's quite chunky but I knew that and it still sits on my wrist well. I love that I can attach it to my gym vest and wear as a necklace too, so I don't always have to wear the bracelet. It's comfortable, I wear it to bed as well. Other reviews say the bracelet isn't secure.. I believe it could definitely be improved as I have had it fall off a couple of times but that's over a couple of months and as long as you wear it snug then it's quite safe. The way it links on is very loose hooks so that's why it can come off if the wristband doesn't have enough tension. It makes it more fiddly to put on and take off as well but I got used to it quickly.It comes well packaged and has a spare battery and a special tool to help unscrew and replace it. I haven't replaced mine yet as only had it a couple of months, I'm not sure how long each battery lasts yet or how to get a new battery when I need one but I'm assuming the website covers that info.The app looks good, is simple and easy to use. Neat user experience. It's definitely more of a lifestyle tracker than a fitness tracker although I can log various exercise activities and it's great for monitoring steps and rough calorie counts. As well as movement it also tracks sleep, menstrual cycle, meditation and finally stress which is just a calculation of all the above. This is more of a guide and doesn't literally track stress as it's just a calculation but it can give you a heads up sometimes! It doesn't do much else so it feels like quite a high-level lifestyle/activity tracker so if you want more detailed tracking it might be sensible to look at a few other products but for what it does do and the look of it I really get on with it great and wear it non-stop.",Great as a lifestyle tracker and looks lovely compared to ugly digital wrist bands,4
2016-12-28,"I love it! Keeps me up to date on my activities. Love the meditation component. And, bonus points! It's really pretty. People comment all the time and are amazed when I tell them it's a fitness tracker. The leather wrap around can be tricky sometimes, but other than that...I love it!",Who said fitness trackers had to be plain ol' strips of black plastic?,5
2016-12-13,It's very easy to use and comfortable to wear.  Other health trackers are usually made out of a material that causes irritation when you sweat but because of its smooth base and leather bracelet you hardly notice you're wearing it.  The fact that you can clip it on to your clothing means that high impact sport and sleeping is very comfortable.  I love mine and use it every day!!,Best I've Tried.,5
2017-01-04,"I love how bellabeat looks like a nice piece of jewelry and can be worn in multiple ways (necklace, bracelet, or clipped on clothing). It tracks everything from sleep to exercise to meditation. I really enjoy the stress indicator which is a combination of all data entered. Data can be added manually or automatically.  Sometimes the sleep data is inaccurate and it takes a few tries to sync it with my android. I hope that this app eventually links with Samsung's SHealth and my fitness pal which are my other favorite fitness apps!",I love how bellabeat looks like a nice piece of jewelry ...,4
2020-01-10,"I love the look of the device and ordered it directly from the company.  For a good month, I could not get it to work correctly.  The device would not sync and later learned that certain androids do not pair well.  I wrote to the company and they wrote back right away and suggest I tighten the screws on the device.  I did and it worked 200% better.  I was happy with that result... but the deal-breakers were multiple issues.  1)It took me 20 minutes or more to figure out how to put on the device one handed.  It's such a cute bracelet feature but impossible to put on by yourself.  I figured out a few tricks to make it easier but the fastening remained quite cumbersome.The device is not made for one-handed fastening like a watch.  2)the device overcalculates steps.  It seemed quite sensitive and wrist moment ended up counting as steps.  3)the straps ended up causing a rash!  I had to stop wearing it all together.  These issues were discovered and then affirmed AFTER THe warranty expried.  Company would not stand by their product.  They have my money so I hope they use it wisely.  I won't be buying from them again.",Love the concept and the design but too many issues.,1
2017-01-24,"I absolutely love my Leaf. I got it as a Christmas present and haven't really taken it off since.

Wouldn't be without it.",Fantastic,5
2018-11-15,"I was previously very pleased with my Leaf. I started having issues with it just a few months after receiving it- it has been losing data often. I reached out to the customer support and they just spouted back to me the same troubleshooting options that are easily found on their website, and when I informed them I found and tried that all out, they just didn’t respond. This interaction was repeated two or three more times, before they just completely stopped responding to me. I've asked for them to fix my leaf or send a replacement and they will not respond to me. I had high hopes for this, but I am so disappointed in the outcome and customer service.",Very poor customer service,2

2017-01-01,"The leaf is really difficult to stay clipped. It falls off my clothes almost every time I change position and often comes unhooked fromthe necklace and bracelet accessories.I appreciate how pretty it is and how durable - it fell off the chain and into the sink full of hot water and was okay. The leaf app is very clean and user friendly.Overall I don't think it is worth the price. It doesn't do much an app wouldn't do, besides counting steps, and half the time I might as well not be wearing it. I can log meditation, and menstrual cycles on an app with no input from a tracker just as easily.",More Decorative Than Useful,3
2017-01-16,I have been so impressed with this activity tracker. It looks so much better than any other tracker and it does a really great job. I love that it tracks my sleep and how much deep sleep I get every night. The reminders throughout the day to keep moving are awesome. The app is easy to use. I've been recommending it to everyone I know.,"Amazing, stylish activity tracker",5
2017-05-18,I just got the Leaf a few days ago but I'm already seeing its benefits!  The sleep monitor is accurate as is the number of steps taken.  It's really opened my eyes to how much I move or don't move for that matter!  I'm looking forward to using the period tracker!,Loving it!,5
2016-11-09,I love my leaf urban. I've had a fitbit and a garmin more than once. I like the Leaf Urban because it tracks my stress and looks like jewelry AND it's really water resistant - I can wear it in the shower without worrying that it will break. I highly recommend this to all women.,Great New Tracker!,5
2016-12-27,Great product! Like anything it needs some improvement but overall it is perfect for my needs!The main reason I wanted this was to keep track of my meditation and to help boost my activity level. Constantly seeing it on my wrist makes me do just that. And the vibration reminders help me to get off my bum if I have been sitting for too long.The only thing I really have issues with is the sleep tracking. It doesn't work the greatest. Some nights it tracks accurately (I know because I'm up frequently with a new born and log hours) and other nights it couldn't be more off. Being able to manually put in sleep time helps track sleep so I am still getting the visual and tracking that I hoped for. I just know that it is a rough estimate of hours and isn't totally accurate but it gets close enough.Overall great product! cant wait to see how it changes over the years!,Great gift!,4
2016-11-30,I received my Urban Leaf about a month ago and absolutely love it. It looks like jewelry and is so much more elegant and classy than the plastic or rubber wrist band types on the market.The versatility of the bellabeat is by far the best for my lifestyle.,Classy and Elegant,5
2017-01-23,"I have no problem wearing my Bellabeat all the time with so many options: bracelet, necklace, and clip. I'm focusing on my stress level this year and the stress feature helps me.

2016-12-14,This is the first fitness tracker I have owned so I can't compare it to other makes and models. I have had it about 6 weeks I love it.  I feel it is pretty accurate.  Daily I use the activity tracker the sleep function.  I enjoy the meditation aspect of this but must be honest I don't use it as often as I should.  I love that I have options where to place the tracker.  I do feel it does a slightly better job tracking sleep when clipped to my pajamas and a better job with motion when on my wrist- although I've yet to wear it as a necklace.  Some improvements I would recommend are providing a longer chain for the necklace - I feel it's a bit too short for the bulk of the piece.  Also when I try to update the sleep tracking like if i wake up and go back to sleep it looses my periods of sleeplessness.  I could just add the additional time as a nap.  All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.,stylish way to monitor your health.,4
2017-10-30,"I simply love this product. I have the Urban Leaf for over a month now and I am really enjoying it. I like that it's really an all-around lifestyle and health product and not just an activity tracker. Recently the extra feature of logging your daily water intake was added to make the product even more complete. It's great that you can track activity, stress, meditation, water intake, sleep, and period. And it's also a really beautiful product, so I'm happy to wear it visibly to show it off. It's also very easy in use, I sync in the mornings and evenings with the app and that's it. I can highly recommend this to anyone looking for a health tracker that's more all around and not specifically for sports and would like something more elegant.",Beautiful and all around health tracker,5
2017-08-31,"I was given the fitness tracker as a gift. First complaint is it is really difficult to see the app. The font is too small and light. 2 months after receiving it I had to change the battery. After I changed the battery it would no longer sync. There is not a live person to talk to for assistance. My husband finally was able to locate a phone number and talk to a person. He said Samsung did an update on their phones and Bellabeat's app was no longer compatible. It has been over a month since I first contacted the company. My tracker still does not work. I am attaching their response. They do not stand behind their product. This is way too much money to spend on a fitness tracker that I was only able to use for 2 months.Support (Bellabeat)Aug 31, 11:09 EDTHi there Edie, Thanks for reaching out to us. We are sorry that you are having some issues connecting your Leaf to our app, and let me try to clarify some things for you.  As you already know, Samsung recently released an update which is causing some issues for some Samsung phones communicating with Bluetooth accessories, which is, unfortunately, affecting the sync with the Leaf as well. Not to worry our Developers are trying to find a solution for this issues and hopefully, they will get this resolved before Samsung does.Also, not every phone can connect to our Leaf, and we have this information available on our website. For Android users, it's a little tricky because there are so many different Andriod providers, Samsung, Google Nexus, HTC One, Sony Xperia, Motorola,  LG, etc. And this issue you are experiencing is only affecting some Samsung users, only Samsung users with S5, Note4, S6 have been affected by this Firmware update, while Samsung 7 has not been affected since they stopped releasing this update to all their products after they released this issue. Regarding a refund, we offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you are over this, then we are unable to refund you. Also, I can see that you wrote in our order number section that it was a gift, but we would need this Leaf's order number if purchased from our web shop. Since if purchased elsewhere then they would have your money and you would have to contact them. And if there is anything else I can clarify for you, please just let me know! All the best, Margret",Will not work with Samsung App and the company will not fix the problem nor refund me the money. Horrible customer service.,1
2017-01-17,"I believe everyone has hit the nail on the head with their reviews of this product. I have had it for a few days, and I wasn't surprised with any of the features of the Leaf Urban because I've read the reviews.Basically the cons are:-bracelet clips have no closure, so it's easily unhooked-bracelet colors are not customizable, you get what you get-doesnt connect to myfitnesspal for calorie input (if the app offered the food journal, it would solve the problem as well)-vibration doesnt tell you why its vibrating (if the app had a pop up to tell you why, it would be ideal)The pros are:-it FAR surpasses all other fitness trackers that I have see in terms of aesthetics, knocks it out of the park-Leaf Urban is smaller and much easier to wear-cycle tracker is VERY useful, and reduces the number of apps I use-focuses on meditation, sleep and cycle, and shows their impact to stress levels (GREAT FEATURE)-vibrates as reminders and alarms (I have begun to ignore my phone alarms because I have so many of them. It forces me to focus on the important ones)-makes me feel like I'm on the Enterprise every time I have to sync. *tap* *tap* ""captain to the bridge"" (haha, all kidding aside, its very strange to have to do that, but I just need to get used to it)That's about it! I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a tracker thats more fashionable to wear.",Great tracker and highly recommend!,4
2016-12-02,"I was in the market for a health/activity tracker and didn't like any of the options out there. I'm a big fan of wearing accessories and love my analog watch, so I didn't want to commit to wearing something as a bracelet everyday. That's what led me to this product - and it's fulfilled that purpose and more! It's gorgeous... love the design. It's also been very easy to use and I've been getting great insights and results. App is fantastic and has been updated and improved a few times since I received the Leaf Urban. The guided meditation and breathing exercises are a nice added bonus. It doesn't have a heart rate monitor, but that's not something I was interested in. If you want to wear it in different ways (bracelet, necklace, clip) you have to log the change in the app, but it's super easy.Overall this is ideal for someone looking for a simple and stylish way to improve their lifestyle and health.",Simple and beautiful health tracker,4
2017-01-13,"i really did have high hopes for this one.  I was excited that it had several features, different from Fitbit.  The period tracker- has nothing to do with the device.  It is a feature in the app and you input the date of your period and it tells you when to expect it again.  You don't need to buy the device in order to do it. Second, I was excited for the stress tracker and predictor. However, the the device does not have a heart rate monitor so the app guesses when you will be stressed. It does so based on your level of activity and sleep and other factors.  Which leads me to my next complaint, the sleep tracker.  It doesn't acually track your sleep.  It uses the time that you lay down and uses an algorithm to decide when it thinks you are in deep or light sleep.  It is not actually tracking your sleep.  I lay down and read for about an hour.  The nights that I tracked my sleep it said I slept soundly through the night but instead woke up many times but continued to lay in bed.  During those times it guessed that I was sleeping soundly.  So basically I found that it is just a really pretty step tracker, so if that is all you need then buy this.  But if you are excited about the other features you will be disappointed.",I had high hopes,2
2017-01-12,"I received my Bellabeat for Christmas after years of returning my fitbit because ti simply wasn't attractive and I did not see myself every actually wearing it an holding myself accountable. As far as aesthetics, I freaking LOVE my Bellabeat - I get so many compliments - it really is a statement piece of jewelry with the versatility and finesse to wear daily!My only complaint is I feel like the device functionality was a bit over-promised - I haven't been able to master how Bellabeat can teach me about the QUALITY of my sleep - it looks like it just takes into account the fact that I haven't moved for a significant amount of time. Also, I find when I wear it as a necklace (especially over a chunkier or cowl-neck sweater) that it doesn't track my steps as accurately.On the plus side, I like that it holds me accountable to stay moving (I have a very sedentary desk job). The step tracker definitely offers perspective. It also encourages a daily meditation practice that I have been trying to get into myself and I am finding that the App is definitely aiding in me actually setting the time aside to do so.And finally, I'd really love an integration with MyFitnessPal so I am hoping that can happen soon!",Bellabeat is beautiful and holds you accountable!,4
2017-01-23,Great tool for women.  I like that it helps track my cycle (as I'm not very good at that) and it's very user friendly.  It's pretty and functional!,Fun and Useful Accessory,5
2017-10-08,"I bought both this urban LEAF and a silver natural one (which I will gift to my sister) from the Bellabeat website during a sale. Since I live in the UK I had to pay customs charges and my main disappointment was that the value of the item on the package was the full value and not what I actually paid, since this meant I had a massive customs charge and made me very unhappy. My own fault though and I don't think there's anything Bellabeat could have done about it.I decided that this was the health tracker I wanted to go for because I don't have to wear it as a bracelet because I really dislike having anything on my wrist, and my wrists are tiny which means everything is way too loose. So far I'm enjoying being able to wear it as a necklace, I've worn it as a bracelet during sport (bought the mint sport bracelet, which I will come to later), and the clip is actually a great idea.Step Tracker:Generally I'm very happy with the way steps are tracked. I've found that the step tracker is surprisingly accurate, but it does need about five minutes of constant movement for steps to be tracked. So if I get up in the night to get a glass of water, it won't count those steps. Similarly during the day if I am working at my desk and head to the printer, if I am moving for less than five minutes, it frequently does not track those steps. It is possible to set two types of movement goals - minutes of activity or number of steps. I started trying to track minutes of activity as number of steps has been disproven as a good way of keeping active, but I reached my target of 20 minutes of activity within an hour of getting up each day - which defeated the purpose of trying to get MORE activity into my day.You can also manually add activities to the activity tracker, but there is only a limited number of activities to choose from. So while it's strange and cool that I can choose to log when I have sex (yes, that's an available activity) and shopping is now apparently also an activity, spinning is not. And the closest to my gym routine is the circuits training, which is also not accurate. I can't just say I've done so and so many reps on the chest press or vertical bar, which would be a really nice function to have.Sleep tracker:This is scarily accurate with how long I am asleep for. It asks me if it's right with how long I've slept, and is usually accurate within 15 minutes of by having gotten into bed, which is actually likely to be accurate. However when i am awake in the night and am moving around (getting a glass of water, going to the bathroom) I get no credit for steps taken. Also when I sleep badly it still tells me I'm lucky to have gotten 7 hours of sleep. Yes okay it's an okay quantity of sleep, but maybe a message of ""You have had a fairly restless night: see if you can nap today"" would be nicer.Meditation:I love the meditations. I wish there were more of them and a greater variety of them and i could have them play without having to have the screen light on on my device, but yeah they put me right to sleep. Which is basically the most important thing about them.Stress tracker:This is my main issue with the LEAF. I hoped that the stress tracker would pick up on my day to day signals - faster heart rate, other things about my life which might indicate that I am experiencing stress. Instead it's just combining the other three things it measures about me and tells me I'm not stressed. Which is not true and whenever I have a mini meltdown and am told that my I'm stress resistant it's not helping. So I'm hoping future versions are better. We will see.Finally, Period tracker:I can't judge since I'm trying out new contraception which is messing with my cycle. So far I've not entered any data but this will change.I hope that in future Bellabeat continues to work on their products and improves them even more - I'll be keeping an eye out and hopefully if my LEAF dies there will be a new version which will be even better. And potentially not cost me an arm and a leg in customs charges.Accessories:Sport bracelet is okay, but I will have to cut off a piece from the end of the strap so I don't have a random dangly bit sticking up - as the LEAF isn't waterproof I basically use it to stop the leather bracelet getting smelly and gross, but it's nothing special.Th leather bracelet was really difficult to figure out how to put it on, and I technically need another hand to close it and open it.Necklace is surprisingly my most frequent mode of wearing my LEAF. The metal is of high quality, and although there are a lot of loops for lengths it still looks nice.",Very pretty but with room for improvement,3
2017-01-24,"Originally I was debating between this product and the newest fit bit (charge HR? I think).  I bought them both on Black Friday but returned the Fitbit because Kohl's cash expired before I could use it and that made me mad.  So I had no basis for comparison.  I have previously used the Jawbone up which I really liked except for the thick bracelet feel.  Soooo, there are things about this product that I do like and that I would like to see improved.  I really like the necklace aspect because I didn't like wearing the jawbone UP (or a fitbit) on my wrist ALL the time.  I am in the medical field and have to wash my hands constantly and that was annoying.  I also prefer sleeping with the necklace on rather than a bracelet.  I don't really use the stress app and the period tracker is ok.....I have a better app for free from online.  I also think the Jawbone Up app is more user friendly and details data much better than the leaf BUT the leaf is cute (albeit a bit bigger than I would like) and I forget Im wearing it most of the time so it CAN track easily and its easy to sync.  I hope they make the app more fun and useful....and that being said....so Far I still have my leaf:)",Leaf Tracker versus other fitness trackers,4

2017-01-12,"I LOVE my new Bellabeat Leaf Urban! My favorite feature is the sleep tracker. I only gave 4 stars, because right now the default is to begin tracking sleep at 9 pm or later, but there are nights I fall asleep earlier than 9 pm and that sleep is not tracked or accounted for. I submitted an email to the Helpdesk and they responded within 4 days, saying this is something they are currently improving to track sleep during the day. Two of the main reasons I wanted the Leaf Urban were for its fashionable feminine look (not a clunky price of rubber on my wrist) and the fact that it does not have to be connected to Bluetooth all the time.

My favorite part is that the Leaf looks and feels just like jewelry. I get a lot of people asking about, what it is, tell me they like it and can't believe when they find out it's also a fitness tracker.I wear it primarily as a bracelet, but it can also clip on or be worn as a necklace. There is a place in the app to change these settings so it can accurately count your steps. I have worn both the Nike fuel band and a Fitbit in the past, and like my Leaf Urban the best. The sleep tracker is usually very accurate, but I found my daily steps to be higher with the Leaf than my Fitbit, but I simply upped my daily step goal to adjust. Occasionally, the Leaf does come unclasped when worn as a bracelet, but I feel it and haven't lost my Leaf yet. I was also worried because it is a little bulky that it might get caught on clothing, etc but this hasn't been an issue at all.

2017-01-24,"There are lots of pluses to this health tracker! I love the meditation exercises that can be downloaded and the options to do a short (2 minute) or a longer (10 min) session since sometimes there is just limited time.  I also like the steps tracker and it appears to be pretty accurate.  The sleep information (light versus deep sleep cycles) is so interesting and helps me better understand the times of the night where I frequently get my best sleep.  Although the Tracker is attractive I do struggle with the best place to wear it.  The bracelet is difficult to put on by yourself and does fall off if bumped, so I quit using it as a bracelet.  Hooking it to my pants has also caused challenges since it can fall off when using the bathroom (I did this once and panicked when I realized it was gone.  Luckily a coworker found it and gave it to the receptionist!).  The necklace is so obvious that I don't feel comfortable wearing it to work every day.  So any improvements in how to wear the tracker would be greatly appreciated.  I also agree that it would be great if it synced with My Fitness Pal! Looking forward to how this item evolves :).",Lots of pluses ++++,4
2018-03-19,"I have owned and used this Bellabeat Urban for almost two years off an on. I have also used a fitbit and a misfit. both more reliable products and a better investment.Here are my reasons to abandon this company for Fitbit.1. My bellabeat has always had difficult tracking sleep accurately. One day it didn't track sleep at all. There is no hotline only a ""contact us"" form.  It was three days between my initial request for assistance and the first response.2. When I did get a response the individual did not appear to have read the message that was sent to her. I specifically stated that I had already tried all the steps listed on the website FAQ and the advice given seemed to be copy and pasted from that section.3. When I repeated my message and pointed out that I had already tried the things she listed, I was instructed to use my bellabeat in a way that it was not designed. Basically they told me to wear it as a clip instead of a bracelet but go into the app and select the ""bracelet"" option. At this point it is obvious that there have been problems with this device not functioning in the way it was designed meaning that there is something wrong with the product. The customer should not have to MacGyver a solution for a product to work. I don't want a huge clip pressing into my chest or side while sleeping. If it doesn't function the way it was designed then that is a company issue.4. When I pointed out that I wanted to use the device the way it was designed and that the product I have does not work as designed and so I would need a replacement, I was told that the product was past warrantee and therefore there was nothing that could be done. Except to ""troubleshoot"" by using the device in a way that it was not intended to be used.5. I chose Bellabeat because I thought it was a product designed for women's health as a response to the mainstream products. I wanted to support a small company. I have had several other fitness trackers, all that tracked sleep and fitness much more accurately than the bellabeat and were easier to use. (waterproof/ resistant, easy to buy replacement accessories, cute and lightweight). Even beyond warrantee when there was a problem with the device THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT.I will never waste my money on a product from Bellabeat again. If you don't stand behind your product then why should I. Fitbit or Misfit will replace any malfunctioning product and they respond to messages (helpfully) within hours. The product is not very user friendly, it's a huge pain in the ass to get any new accessory and now it doesn't work. Subpar product and TERRIBLE service",Subpar product and TERRIBLE service,2

2017-02-15,"While I love the product and the freedom to add in my specific exercises, it does have some tweaks that could be made. For example, the step tracking and activity time is far from accurate. I can be walking around a classroom and the activity warning, which I have set for every hour, goes off. Also, the sensors that are supposed to know when you are sleeping are not always accurate, I frequently have to edit the times.",Tweaks needed,4

2017-04-12,I've only had it for a few days but it's working out so far. It's really more beautiful in person and I've received compliments on it. (Mostly wearing as a bracelet.) Learning how to use it is a bit of a challenge. I forgot to tell it which mode I was wearing it and ended up with some strange (high) step counts. I'm also not sure what is determined as activity and what is not. I really like the meditation tracking and the activity reminders.,Still figuring it out,4
2017-01-20,I love my Leaf Urban.  I was losing my motivation with my Fitbit.  I need something new and this is a beautiful addition to my wardrobe!  I have used the meditations that come along with the app and feel less stressed.  It is well worth the price!,I love my Leaf Urban,5
2017-01-11,I ordered a leaf for my daughter and on her recommendation ordered another for myself. I love the look of it and its ability to keep me active just by wearing it. I feel I have not yet scratched the surface of its usefulness. Highly recommend.,Love it!!,5
2016-11-23,"I really like my Bellabeat Leaf Urban. I have received many compliments on it and shocked faces when I tell them it's a fitness/health tracker.  I wear it mostly as a necklace since I can't seem to get it to slip on any clothing I own and the bracelet component is hard to manage. When I try to put the bracelet pieces on, the clips slip out very easily and I get frustrated after many failed attempts and I also get nervous that it'll fall off while I'm out. I was looking for a different bracelet piece, maybe in a different color and a different clasp to attach to the Bellabeat, but I can't seem to find one that's a Bellabeat brand. The additional accessories on the Bellabeat site are for the Leaf and not the Urban.Anyway, I'm going to continue using it and I'll hold out for the additional accessories. It was definitely worth buying.","Enjoying it, but it isn't perfect yet.",4
2017-01-01,"I'm really enjoying my new Bellabeat Leaf Urban.  I love the balance it has between focusing on activity, sleep and mediation.  It's already motivating me to return to meditation, something that I haven't done for a while and really missed.  I'm learning that on some days I'm very active running around after the family but that on other days I need to add it a bit of extra walking etc to boost my activity levels.The leaf really suits my needs and overall I'm really pleased.  I'm looking forward to the planned updates for the app - especially on sleep.In the future it would be great if the leaf could be waterproof, i think the leaf would be more secure if the bracelet had closing clips rather than hooks and I would love to be able to temporarily change the colour of the background behind the silver leaf (could just wear it as a clip on those days)- all good so far.  I like the fact that I can wear it lots of ways and it doesn't look like an activity tracker.(When I had a question about the leaf, Bellabeat emailed me back within 48 hours which was great)",Loving Leaf Urban,4

At night I clip it to my top and it is 90% accurate with my sleep, it has occasionally shown that I went to bed an hour later than I actually did.  All in all would recommend!",Love this!,5
2017-03-27,"As soon as I first heard of the Bellabeat from its concept stage I was a fan & immediately signed up to their mailing list.The first edition came out, it was more expensive than I had anticipated & the shipping costs to the UK at that point on top of the selling price meant that me, without a job & claiming ill health benefits I'd be saving for quite some time. Still, I kept watching reviews on YouTube from bloggers etc & then came the release of the urban.At this point I was now back working part time as hairdresser so the urban ticked more of the boxes being waterproof (well not completely, but it was ok to wear while shampooing a client). Then for valentines this year I received an email for the rose gold urban but getting an extra wrist band & silver clip as well & free shipping.  I weighed up the options & decided now was my time.The Leaf arrived quickly, I downloaded the app & everything seemed simple enough to set up & use. I did notice that clipping the leaf to me for sleep it only gave a rough time of your sleep & I was expecting more of a detailed sleep pattern as I do have restless sleep. When you are walking it is best to have it on your wrist because wearing it elsewhere on your body for me it never even tracked that I was moving which when I'm stood up & walking around all day & my tracker says I did 20 steps I figured something was wrong. I did once wear it clipped to my waistband for a day (the bracelet would of looked too bulky for my outfit that day). However, removing the leaf at the end of the day & finding a hole in what you were wearing wasn't exactly my ideal 2nd choice either.The MAJOR issue I do have is the design flaw with the bracelet strap & how it fixes to the leaf. For me this kept becoming unclipped & on several occasions the leaf nearly fell off completely. That was until today when it did....I don't know where, I don't know when but now I have a spare bracelet, a spare clip & a necklace for a leaf urban if anyone wants them! On looking at the design of the original Bellabeat the strap does attach differently, I would definitely take something being splashproof over wasting more than £150 for 4 weeks use.Either that or they could add a tracker to their next updated model.",Design Flaws & could use improvement,2

2016-11-29,"I've had the BB Leaf Urban for almost a month. I like that it has a sleek design and it's pretty while still being a ""tracker"".Here are some of my thoughts on it:ACTIVITY: I like that it tracks steps and you can enter physical activity that you do. (Unfortunately it doesn't differentiate exertion level per activity.).MEDITATION: i haven't yet used any of their ""guides"" meditation. I also don't see where I can enter my own mediation that is not part of their guided ones.SLEEP:  this is my biggest struggle with this device. I have a newborn and I wake several times during the night to feed. For the most part it sometimes gets confused as to when I'm actually awake or sleeping. You can adjust you start and end sleep times but if you do it will reclassify any of your awake times to ""light sleep"" so it usually won't accurately capture your sleep time if you wake up during the night.  (This is why I gave it a 3 v 5 stars. If this were a better sleep tracke I would give it five stars).Overall I like the BB leaf urban. I'm glad I bought it. Hopefully when my baby starts sleeping through the night I will then have better sleep readings on it.",Overall like it - doesn't track sleep very well if you wake often,3
2018-05-14,"I have had my Leaf for a couple of months now and I really like it. It seems to track my steps accurately and I have no problem feeling the light vibration when my morning alarm goes off or when the Leaf is letting me know I've been inactive for too long. I also like the meditation options and the period tracker is super handy. The only thing I'd like to see improved is the sleep monitor. I think mine tells me the exact same thing every day (""you were quite restless last night..."") even when it shows long periods of deep sleep. However, that is just a small annoyance and would not deter me from buying this again or recommending it to a friend. I love the fact that you can clip it to your waist and it's completely out of site, because I don't really like people knowing or commenting about my use of a health tracker.",... for a couple of months now and I really like it.

2019-01-30,So the mark of a good company is it's customer service. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL! The leaf isn't practical. It's to bulky and heavy to wear as a watch or a bracelet  which leaves you with the clip. Mine has continuously fallen off...about 10 times and luckily I didn't lose it. So when I contacted customer service they had a smug service rep who literally didn't do anything to help and just act very condescending. It's like he knew that the company he works for  really doesn't  care if the product is defective or works as designed they already got their money. BUY ANOTHER fitness tracker ...it's not worth it.

2017-01-17,"I recvd this as a present for Christmas & now I feel even worse after coming here & seeing how much my well-intentioned mother spent on this crap. This thing is heavy, bulky, not discreet AT ALL, a PITA to have to sync everyday, & not very high-tech.First, this thing sticks up a good 1/4 in depth & is not very conducive to wearing as a bracelet, especially if you need to look professional or be streamlined in anyway. It's another 1&3/4"" long & 3/4"" wide. There is nothing delicate, small or inconspicuous about this piece of ugh... jewelry.Second, it doesn't just record data & automatically sync with the app. No, that would be too easy. One has to remember to sync it everyday & who has time for that?Third, it sort-of does what it says it will but not really. It keeps data on the amt & quality of sleep one gets but this data I've noticed seems pretty different depending upon if it's worn as a bracelet or a necklace. The only feature I've been impressed with is that it seems to get good data on light/vs deep sleep. That's useful. However, all of the other data that it collects is easily collected by apps we are already running, for FREE, that don't require daily mgt. Plus, the app asks for access to those other apps & seems to get its data like steps from other fitness apps I'm already using. Also, with the sleep feature let me make a Warning: if you sleep at any other time before about 9pm or after 9am for whatever reason the device doesn't record it. There have been days I've slept mostly during the day with just a few hrs during the night but the app doesn't record the daytime sleep on it's own & will automatically assume I've only slept 2 or 3 hrs TOTAL for the entire 24hr period. So if you're a shift worker or just someone with a no traditional sleep schedule- BEWARE! This device will NOT track your daylight hrs sleep.Something else it's supposed to track is ""meditation"" minutes. That may be great for some ppl but it's not the most important data for me to track. I wish that one could choose what data they'd like to track like sleep (regardless of the time of day), steps, weight (believe it or not there's no way to track weight changes in the app that one cld then correlate with sleep, activity, etc DUH PEOPLE!), diet, meds, symptoms, heart rate, etc etc & then customize their experience.Overall, it's WAY WAY WAY too much money for something most ppl get for free from other apps. The only benefit I've seen is tracking depth of sleep but even that doesn't work well. It's far too bulky to easily wear as jewelry day & it's a giant pain to download the data every day. The data that it does collect isn't very accurate or even useful at all (minutes meditating). I have other apps that do these things for FREE & carrying my phone is no more wk than wearing the giant, bulky, heavy thing they sell.Save your money & don't buy this.","BIG, Giant, Bulky Thing; Other apps do it all for FREE",1

Even so, according to my Leaf, I've slept a solid 8 hours and is apparently looking beautiful... well, I can assure you neither is correct. Even though I was up walking, and noted the times I were up, the app says I was in ""deep sleep"" during the same exact time. Yup. Great tracking, there! In other words: the sleep tracker is rubbish and can't be trusted. The alarm buzz is ok though, and actually wakes me up, but it's wise to have an extra alarm with sound on if you're a heavy sleeper, cause it doesn't buzz for long and the buzzing is very light.The step tracker seems correct, I've compared it to the one already on my phone and they're about the same.Would I buy this product again?

2018-02-22,"I hoped to post this review on another Leaf listing, but it wouldn't let me because I'm not an Amazon Verified purchaser. I bought mine directly from the Bellabeat site and asked for a refund today.I've worn a Fitbit for about three years before buying the Leaf a few weeks ago. I was looking for a beautiful tracker that gave me the perfect mix of form and function. The Fitbit's HR monitoring was nice when I was actively counting calories for weight loss and doing non-stepping exercises (weightlifting, biking) but as I get most of my activity from walking/running step tracking alone works for me.THE GOOD: At first I was quite happy with the Leaf. I liked the addition of meditation tracking to the usual physical activity, water, and sleep tracking. I've found that maintaining all of those aspects of my life is crucial to managing my overall wellness and mental health. It has a wide range of activities to select from when manually adding exercise. And of course, it's pretty. I also bought their Spring water bottle because I was curious. The Spring worked well enough, but needed calibration a few times over the course of its use to be accurate. I also sometimes had issues getting it to sync, but it didn't seem to lose any data. Going forward I'll suck it up and log my water intake manually with a bottle that doesn't cost $80+.THE BAD: I wasn't fond of the Bellabeat app's guided meditations. I much prefer the Calm app, though that is a paid subscription. If you're not looking to pay extra, the Bellabeat meditations should still work for you (or you could look to YouTube for a myriad of guided meditation options). I did not use the menstruation or ovulation trackers, as my birth control renders them unnecessary. I didn't mind syncing to check my stats, but as time went on I found myself missing being able to look at the readout on my wrist.THE DEALBREAKER: I first had syncing issues about two weeks in. I thought the first time might have been because I changed time zones and it glitched for a few hours, or that I didn't sync first thing in the morning so it didn't register I had woken up yet. I worked through the troubleshooting guides, made sure I had the correct position selected in the app, and synced first thing each morning. Then it happened a second time. On the third time it said I had zero activity for an entire day of being up and about at work. This week it only recorded my exercise and not any of my regular movement throughout the day. I reached out to Bellabeat customer service, who said it was a glitch with the app that caused data to not sync. But then it happened again and again and I finally submitted a refund request for both the Leaf and Spring. Bellabeat offered refunds for both products within the same day and let me keep both items to avoid the hassling of returns (for both them and me), though they are now disabled and won't sync with the app.I consider myself lucky all these problems popped up within the 30-day refund period. Maybe I had a dud, I don't know. But if you're looking to buy one, I'd double and triple check the return policy of wherever you go to buy one.","Data loss issues, but Bellabeat customer service is nice.",2

2016-12-22,"Loving my new gadget. My main reason for the Urban Leaf purchase was bra is I wanted something that could do everything a fit bit does but look more feminine.

2017-01-07,"It's beautiful, the app is beautiful, and it just works. The activity tracking is accurate, and sleep tracking is just astonishing.

2021-04-02,"I regret purchasing this. I’ve had it for about 4 months, have had to replace the battery twice already. It is very inconsistent about tracking my steps and sleep, which is basically the only things it does. It doesn’t track heart rate.  The only benefit is that it is pretty.",Disappointed,2

I like the look when wairing it as a necklace, but it is not very accurate in measuring the steps that way. The bracelet is very nice, but a pain to put it on. After trying for 10 minutes I normally give up and only wear it this way when my husband can help me put it on. The clip on is the easies way to wear it and perfect for nights and during exercise.All together I really like it, it is much prettier as the other activity trackers.

2018-03-07,Absolutely love my Bellabeat Leaf. It tracks my sleep better than my Fitbit ever did. I find that my steps are also more accurate. Th only reason I can’t give 5 stars is because the leather wrap bracelet keeps getting twisted and pinching my arm no matter how tight or lose it is.,So cute!,4
2017-01-22,"I've had my Leaf for about a month.  I wanted it mostly for the jewelry-quality appearance.  I was wearing a fitbit charge HR and was tired of wearing  the large plastic thing all the time.  The leaf seems to work well. I get lots of compliments on the appearance of the Leaf. I wear it as a bracelet everyday.  I can't really depend on the vibration alarm to wake me because I am a deep sleeper.  I love the guided meditations on the app.  I hope they continue to expand their meditation library.  My only disappointment is that the Leaf  doesn't link up to MyFitnessPal the way the fitbit did.  Hopefully that will change someday. Overall,  very happy with the Leaf and would buy again.",Most attractive fitness tracker,4
2017-01-16,"I got my leaf urban for Christmas. I have wanted a fitness tracker for some time now but there aren't very many pretty or life proof ones out there. This one seemed to be the answer to my prayers! Mostly I love it. I'm a little disappointed in the accuracy of the sleep tracker. Sometimes I get terrible sleep, up and down all night. I wake up and my leaf says I got great sleep!! That is disheartening. Also I'm a little scepticle of the accuracy of the step tracker as well. I have heard great things about creators and how involved they are, it seems a little over priced for what it does but that's ok as long as improvements are being made. I love the bracelet, necklace and clip!! I'm also not certain if I picked the right leaf for me but time will tell, we are still getting to know each other. I have never meditated and I LOVE the guided meditations, please add more!!!!",I have wanted a fitness tracker for some time now but there aren't very many pretty or life proof ones out there,4
2017-01-24,"I like this tracker quite a bit. It's beautiful and I love the options for period tracking and meditation.  My one problem is that I'm not that confident in the step counter--it varies dramatically based on where I'm wearing the Leaf, and I think it is just not quite as consistent with regular around-the-house steps vs. exercise (running, walking, etc) steps.",I like this tracker quite a bit,4
2017-01-22,I LOVE MY ROSE GOLD URBAN LEAF!! This is my first tracker device and its a perfect fit for me! Im not super athletic so all the other devices didnt appeal to me. This however.. gives me the key features I need to lead a healthy life. It seems to be off from the steps taken with the Google Fit app you link it to so that part is odd.. and it doesnt subtract your awake time from your total amount of sleep.. Outside of that.. I like how ut shows my sleep patterns..how i can keep track of my cycle and my steps I take and be totally fashionable at the same time. Its so comfortable that you dont even know you have it on! The only time I have taken mine off since Christmas is to take a shower!! Cant wait to buy addtl bracelets and a clip so I can switch it up a bit...HOW FUN!BEST XMAS GIFT EVER!! I SO LOVE MY BELLA BEAT! The rose gold is beautiful!!!,I LOVE THIS THING!!,4
2017-01-04,I love the Urban Leaf. I had initially owned the first Leaf and sadly lost it in a rush at the gym. I felt completely lost without my leaf so reordered the Urban since it was released after I had purchased the first one. I especially love the meditation piece. Thanks Bellabeat!,Love the Leaf!,5
2017-01-06,"I got this bracelet as a gift, and wish I could return it. I am so disappointed with the product and can't believe it costs so much money. The marketing of the bracelet makes it seem very high tech but the bracelet only measures steps really and the app is very basic. A couple things I was disappointed with:- The descriptions of the bracelets on the website are very vague regarding what it actually does. Again, sounds high tech and it's really not.- There is no heart rate monitor (I see now that this is actually listed on the website after digging through the FAQ).- The ""stress predicting software"" is common sense. I thought I would get something that knew in real time when I would be getting stressed out (another vague description on your website), but instead I get something like ""you didn't sleep much and you didn't exercise, so you'll probably be stressed today."" I could tell you that without a $140 bracelet.- The app doesn't offer anything that you can't already get for free from the App Store. The Bellabeat app offers very simplistic data interpretation when compared to other apps monitoring the same things. Sleep monitor, pedometer, menstrual cycle tracking, meditation for $140... This doesn't make sense when you can get superior apps for free.- The sleep tracker is horribly inaccurate (off by several hours). It also seems weird to me that the company supports the science behind the sleep tracker and not a heart rate monitor when sleep trackers are notoriously inaccurate and don't actually measure sleep but guesstimate based on your movement.- The pedometer is inaccurate (off by several thousand steps). Considering this is the primary feature of the bracelet, it's pretty concerning that this doesn't work.- It's very clunky. The bracelet is hard to get on and does not fit comfortably. Using the tracker as a clip is difficult too since the material has to be very thin to fit.It was also upsetting that I received this as a Christmas gift and was unable to return it because the person that gave me the gift purchased the bracelet more than 30 days earlier. Not to mention that the gift-giver said they wouldn't have bought it so early if the website hadn't been saying they were almost out of stock. When I asked about a return, I was told there was nothing they could do and they only make exceptions if someone asks about returns before purchasing, which is kind of a weird policy.Overall, it's a pretty bracelet. I think the tech side of it is very cheaply done and there are much better alternatives, but I can see how if somebody only wanted a more attractive pedometer with some other features this would be an okay option. If somebody wants something with higher accuracy and more features, I think there are much better options at around the same price (maybe not as pretty though). I also wish the company was more flexible with the problem solving and more straight-forward about what you're getting. The vagueness, lack of quality, and then my inability to return the product makes it unlikely that I will be getting anything from this company in the future.","Nice jewelry, subpar fitness tracker",1

With the interactive app so I can keep track of what's happening in my day and of my stress sensitivity.  I appreciate that I can enter times for specific activities, that I can choose the lengths of meditations, that I evaluate my sleep.

A few downsides is that I can't log going to bed before 9 and I wake up really early so sometimes need this feature.  I did contact them and they said they would put the siggestion in with the developers. Also, I have to maually log my meditation because I do it through the headspace app instead of the bellabeat feature, but it has been motivating altogether and I like the versatility of putting it in different locations.",I have really enjoyed my bellabeat,4

The guided meditations are nice in that you can select a shorter version if time is limited; e.g., slipping a 3 minute calming session before a meeting on days when you are less resistant to stress.

2016-12-27,"My husband bought me this for Christmas and I was so excited to use it.  But sadly the design is quite flawed.  I wore it as a bracelet a few times but it kept coming un-hooked and I was afraid I would lose it.  I liked wearing it as a clip but it was really hard to get on that way.  So one night I wore it out to dinner with friends as a necklace.  At one point I leaned over and the leaf rested on the table.  When I sat back up, it had fallen off.  Thankfully I saw it and re-attatched it but by the time I got home it was lost again and I have never been able to find it.  It is a fitness tracker, for goodness sake, so I assume that staying in place during movement is implied.  I wore it for less than a week....So that was a lot of money down the drain.

I have had the best luck tracking sleep and steps while wearing it as a bracelet, but the bracelet itself is irritating -- it is difficult to put on by yourself and it often comes undone.  Having access to a different kind of adjustable bracelet would improve the leaf's wearability significantly.  Both yesterday and today I wore my leaf as a necklace and it didn't track any of my activity.

2017-01-01,I am in love with my new Bella Beat! When I started looking at fitness trackers I realized I wouldn't be able to wear the majority of them when I played volleyball (which is my main activity) so when I found the Bella Beat I was so thrilled I could just clip it on my shirt and go! It does not have a heart rate monitor but it was not a feature I needed in my fitness tracker. I do love that it offers me activities for destressing and that it is tailored for women with the menstrual cycle tracking. The only thing I wish the Bella beat would do is have the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the sleep tracking so I didn't have to record naps. Other than that I am in love with it!,I am in love with my new Bella Beat,4
2017-03-20,I got my leaf about a month ago and so far am enjoying it. I like the look of it so much more than my previous Fitbit. I can wear it with my business professional outfits at work and not be self-conscious. I use the activity reminders as a push to get up from my desk during the day when I've been sitting too long. I don't think the functionality is as comprehensive as the Fitbit from a fitness tracking standpoint but I think for a step counter and reminder it's serving its purpose.,I like the look of it so much more than my ...,4
2017-01-14,I got the Leaf Urban for Christmas and love it! I dress up for work and wanted a fitbit but thought I wouldn't wear it to work so this is perfect. I love the app the sleep tracker and the meditation.,Love this!,5
2017-01-21,"Incredible way of balancing activity,sleep and meditation.  Has enabled me to be resistant to stress since started using!! Highly recommended",Highly recommended,5
2017-01-12,I enjoy the style and functionality of the leaf.  I wanted a tracker for a while but fitbit and the like did not fit my personality or lifestyle.I particularly like the sleep track function of the app to see the different parts of how deeply I am sleeping.,I enjoy the style and functionality of the leaf,4
2016-11-16,"I've been using my leaf urban for about 2 months now.Things I love:The look- I get compliments all the timeThe different options to wear as a bracelet, as a necklace or clip onThe stress tracker in the appThings that bug me:Its super hard to clip on to anything- you really have to dig your nails under itIt doesn't track my gym workouts, I always end up adding those in manuallyI would love to see a forum or community for other bellabeat users to ask questions and connect.",Great style,4

2017-01-24,"This was given to me as a gift. I have been wearing it everyday and it seems to be working great. It took a bit to get used to since I work at night and it was telling me to sleep when I was working. It has improved with the sleep during my work days and non working days. I love the meditation and stress tracking. I am also still getting familiar with what this has to offer. I have noticed the activity alarm goes off randomly. (ie, I have it set for a period of time and it will go off prior to that length of time.) I believe the more I use it, the more I learn how it works. I love the way it looks!",I have been wearing it everyday and it seems to be working great. It took a bit to get used to ...,4
2017-01-23,"I love the original bellabeat leaf and the bracket that comes with it. I get so many compliments on it that I bought the urban to be able to switch it up. My other is the copper colored with the dark wood. I just can't get the urban bracelet to work because of the clips, they are open and not secure. It falls off when I take my shirt off and that certainly isn't good. I can't decide if I will keep it and buy another bracelet, I'm currently use the old bracelet that came with my other but it doesn't match the silver.",Band is not secure,3
2016-11-19,"I preordered the Urban after seeing it promoted on Facebook.  I waited for what seemed like forever  (in reality,  about 2 months ). I now have been wearing it for about 1 month.  Overall,  I have to say that it was worth the wait.I wear it as a bracelet and receive so many compliments on its stylish loooks.  People are so surprised when they learn that it is actually an activity tracker and not just an artistic piece of jewelry! I also should note that it is very comfortable to wear.  I frequently forget that it's on, except for the vibrating reminders to get up and move that I have set up through the phone app.The phone app is pretty basic,  but easy to use.  It records steps, sleep, meditation,  and menstrual cycles and calculates your daily stress based on this info  (mine hovers around 20-25%, whatever that means ).My favorite functions are the step/activity  (you can manually enter activities from your phone) and the sleep app. I love waking up and syncing my leaf to check  my time and sleep quality. I have discovered that average about  7 hours per night with about 35% deep sleep,  but,  once again,  what does that mean?  How much deep sleep am I ""supposed"" to be getting? Perhaps a little more information provided in the app about the data it offers would be a useful update.Although this lovely little device isn't as high tech as some of its considerably more expensive competitors, it is a beautifully unique option for those of us who have been considering jumping on the fitbit wagon but have been put off by the less than fashionable design.  Overall, I am very pleased with my new urban.  It was money well spent.",Smart Jewelry!,4
2016-11-18,"I love the uniqueness of the Leaf. It just looks lovely.  I really like the meditation links and reminders; having these so easily accessible encourages me to take the time to meditate or refocus.  I'm not convinced about the accuracy of the activity tracker however, in particular when worn on clothes - my fitbit detected a significantly different amount of steps.  I did expect the stress tracker to be more interactive; it seems to just measure sleep versus activity. The graph it produces isnt particularly helpful.For the most part though I'm happy with my leaf, the accessories look lovely too and I'm keen to investigate these further.",Leaf Urban,4

2018-03-29,"I liked my Leaf up until I had to replace the battery for the second or third time and could never get the product to sync with my phone again. After two months of back-and-forth with Bellabeat product support, trying all of the basic troubleshooting methods they could think of, they were unable to pinpoint what went wrong. I just got a Google Pixel 2 and previously had a Samsung Galaxy, so I don't think the company is properly prepared to keep up with Android system updates. Maybe the experience would be different if I had an iPhone.I think other more tech-focused brands are catching up in the appearance department, which was Bellabeat's main competitive advantage to target females. I want to support female-focused brands but they need to be able to evolve with technology to keep their customer base. Now I'm just left with a cute bracelet.",Cute bracelet but can't keep up with technology,2

2017-01-23,"I love the look of my Bellabeat! It is stylish and functional. The sleep tracking is 100% on point and while I'm not sure that the step counter is COMPLETELY accurate when I wear it as a bracelet, it keeps me motivated and active. The one complaint I have is that I prefer to wear it as a bracelet and the leather bracelet it comes with does not have closing clasps on the sides that attach to the leaf - just u shaped hooks with a small opening. This makes putting it on tricky and it has fallen off once or twice. I ordered a new bracelet on Etsy to remedy this.",Beautiful and motivating.,4
2016-12-28,"I've been using this for about two months now, and I love it. I have had a great experience with it tracking both my movements and my sleep, and the added meditation tracking is such great motivation for me to keep up my meditation practice. I also love that I have one place for keeping track of my movement, my cycle and my stress. I've had a few instances when my sleep tracking has been a little off, hence the 4 stars, but you can manually edit the sleep time and add naps, so it's not the biggest deal. I'd recommend it if you're considering a fitness tracker that isn't so movement, but more holistic, focused.",Great tracker for holistic health,4

Love the mediations as I often need them to help get to sleep, would highly recommend to anyone.

I like the activity tracking, and that it goes beyond just steps, and being able to track my sleep patterns. I love the subtle reminders to get up and move around throughout my day. The breathing exercises are very calming before bed. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I'd like to be able to add my own meditation sessions. Right now you can only log those that are done via their set of sessions.","Beautiful, convenient alternative to wellness tracking",4

I would give it a 5 star rating if it had a way to track symptoms within the period tracker and add notes. It connects to other apps, like Google fit, etc.; however, it is easier if everything is stored in one app. My young son loves to do the meditations with me. And the notes of encouragement are sometimes something I need to 'hear.'",Functional and pretty...,4

2017-01-23,"Love my Bellabeat urban leaf as it is very stylish and a great way to track sleep and activity. The only issue I've had with it is that the sleep tracker only seems accurate if you generally have a consistent sleep pattern. Since I'm breastfeeding several times a night, it throws it off a bit. It would be helpful in the app to be able to manually enter the times you woke up at night, but there isn't an option for that. I find myself not wearing it as often because of this. Love the design though and I think with a few updates to the app it would be more helpful","Like, but issues with sleep tracker",3

I love the design and the attractiveness of the tracker.  I find that it is most accurate clipped to my shirt or worn as a bracelet.  I have found it to be a bit inconsistent between wearing as a necklace vs bracelet.  I also like the feature to set an alarm to remember my vitamins.

Overall, though, I'm satisfied with my purchase.",Beautiful way to wear a step tracker!,4
2017-01-20,In general I like the tracker. The sleep monitoring section was enlightening. The only complaint I have is related to the wristband.  It makes it difficult to put on as the band often falls off before I can secure it.  I like the necklace but it is sometimes too long depending on the shirt to wear.  Also. Being water proof would be great. Maybe in the next version,Love it but the wristband is a pain,4

I love using the meditation aspects of the app. It vibrates to let me know when I'm done. The alarm is great. But mostly, I like the sleep tracker. It's beyond accurate. When I remember to wear it to bed, it knows exactly when I've woken up to answer messages or when the cat disturbs my sleep. And, I never have to look like I'm wearing a fitness tracker watch or something. I've gotten so many compliments. I LOVE my Leaf!!",I LOVE my Leaf!!,5

I haven't had any problems syncing the leaf to the app. It has been interesting to see how active I am day to day - while i am a little creeped out by the sleep monitoring, understanding my sleep patterns better, has meant better nights sleep. I haven't used fitness trackers before so I am unable to compare it to another product - for what I was after the Leaf Urban is perfect so far.",A very clever piece of smart jewelry.

2018-02-01,"Shame on you, Bellabeat.My third Leaf Urban came with an active bracelet instead of a leather one like the first two came with.If you refer to my account, you would notice that I bought an active bracelet before for my Leaf Urban Rose Gold too. The active bracelet costs less than the leather one. So you can imagine how I felt when I received the active bracelet in the Leaf Urban Silver set instead of the leather one: Cheated.It feels like a dirty trick. While the price difference of a single bracelet may not be that much, it all adds up to greater profits when one considers volume. Did you have to do that?",All about profits,1
2017-04-14,I love my leaf Urban. I have the rose gold and I get so many compliments on it. I like that it is more like jewelry than other trackers. I appreciate that I don't have to charge it all the time! I got it for Christmas and the battery still had 2 bars. I only wish I could pair it with a health tracker to track food like fitness pal or something along those lines.,I love my leaf Urban,4

2017-01-14,Love my leaf so far! The tracking is right on target. The meditation feature is fantastic. My product shipped quickly and I had it less than a week after ordering. The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is the bracelet is slightly difficult to maneuver. Once it's on its great but its a little tricky.,Love my Leaf!,4

I went back and forth between this and a Fitbit but, ultimately being able to wear it in many different locations is what really won me over. I do wish there were more features available and a bit more accuracy, but nothing to make me want to stop using it. Keeps me motivated!",Great alternative to a classic activity tracker,4
2016-12-28,Love mine!  I find that works best as bracelet. Does not track well when I wear on the necklace. I still love it and it is NOT ugly like most trackers!,Love mine! I find that works best as bracelet,4
2017-01-20,"I love this! It is a beautiful piece of jewelry and a great health tracker at the same time. I bought the Rose Gold edition.The only con is what others have already commented on, the leather bracelet has a tendency to ""break lose"" from the tracker so it falls off the wrist. Therefore I don't dare to exercise using the bracelet-I always use the necklace.Still, it is really useful and beautiful so I have made two of my friends buy trackers.",Love it,4

2017-01-05,"I love how it looks compared to the fitbits on the market, and the tracking works very well.  The meditations are great and short enough to do at a break at work and help to keep my stress level down.  I wish there were other bracelet attachments so that I could change the color I wear.",Attractive and works well,4
2017-01-19,"After 42 years of being told I have too much energy, I decided to put that to the urban to track.  I like the sleep tracking feature, and the ease of adjusting those times. I am currently tracking my sleep patterns, menstrual cycle, and activity.  I like that I can manually adjust  both the the sleep and activity tracker data to reflect more precise information.  I also appreciate the alarm that vibrates.  It is a noninvasive way to wake up.",I like the sleep tracking feature,4
2017-01-19,Got my Bellabeat at Christmas and love it. So easy to wear and the meditation sessions are great so much variety,Best wellness tracker around,5
2017-01-01,This looks really good - much nicer than other activity trackers. It seems pretty accurate in how it records your activity and also sleep patterns. Very impressed with it so far. I like the settings for letting you know if you've been inactive for too long. It could do with having a reminder for doing a meditation too. The phone app could do with a bit of improvement. It's a bit dull and some of the text and graphics are quite small and difficult to read.,Attractive and accurate activity tracker,4
2017-01-20,"Overall, I like the Bellabeat, but as others mentioned, it could use some minor tweaks. The bracelet is difficult to put on and it sometimes falls off - I would really like to see a more 'modern' bracelet to go with it also. I don't think that the sleep tracker is completely accurate - there are some nights, I know I slept horribly and it tells me that I had restful sleep. I do like the meditations that are included with the app. Overall, I like it, but wish it could do more.",I like the Bellabeat,3
2017-01-12,I love my leaf..it motivates me and helps me stay on track with exercise and stress. This is much better than a fitbit and much more visually appealing.,love it!,4
2017-01-16,"I received this tracker as a gift and absolutely love it! It is beautiful, goes with any outfit, and is very versatile. I mostly wear it as a bracelet, but have worn it as both a necklace and a clip. Like any product,  it does have its glitches at times. I do shiftwork, and occasionally on my second night shift it will stop tracking my steps. This has only happened twice in the four months that I've had it. No big deal to me. I like that I can put in my sleep hours during the day and it will measure the quality of sleep similar to night sleep. I no longer track calories, but I can see how integrating this with an app such as my fitness pal would be beneficial for those who do. It's a great product and I think it has lots of potential in the future. I would recommend it to anyone, especially professionals like myself who are looking for a fitness tracker  and want something that will complement any outfit.",Beautiful and versatile!,5
2017-01-05,Love the look of the Bellabeat. Easy to adapt to different styles but the bracelet option is my favorite. The app is easy to use but I find it tedious to log each of my activities. You can make of it what you like I suppose. There are mediations that you can quickly download too to help reduce your stress. I like that this system is more wholistic and takes into consideration many aspects of your day to find balance and reduce stress.,Love the look of the Bellabeat,4
2017-01-20,I just love my bella beat...so pretty. The subtle reminder instead of blaring alarms and the app is so easy to follow. I recommend it all the time.

I attempted to wear it as a bracelet but the design is not secure and it is prone to fall off.  I have also attempted to wear it as a clip but it will not register that I am even wearing it.

2018-03-31,I love my leaf.  It's really convenient that the battery doesn't need to be charged so you get an accurate step count.  The sleep tracking is nice too-it is great feedback that I truly didn't otherwise really pay attention to.

2017-01-20,"Beautiful as a piece of jewelry, super simple to use. Would like to see the alarm be more synced to sleep rhythms (wake me up when I am in light sleep stage closest to my needed wake up time), and have more options for physical activity - was very surprised Nordic (cross country skiing) wasn't an option.","Beautiful, would like a few upgrades",4
2017-01-02,"It was incredibly easy to set up and even easier to use. Only had it a week but I love it! It clips on easily to all my clothes and looks great on the bracelet(although that's a bit fiddly) and i find myself referring to the app throughout the day to track my activity levels, which so far appears to be spot on. Impressed.",Love my leaf.,4
2017-01-12,"I really enjoy using this tracker. The steps are accurate and the sleep tracker as close as you could expect it to be without a hear rate monitor. The guided meditations are also useful. The only real bug bear is the bracelet, which has a tendency to unclip itself so isn't wearable out and about, but is good for overnight.",Wouldnt be without now,4

2017-01-25,I really am enjoying the urban leaf. My goal is to meditate twice a day. Having the stylish leaf as a bracelet has motivated me to set aside the short time to meditate. I have found every once in a while it does not track my steps. Overall I love it.,My self care,4

2016-12-30,A beautiful design. The number of steps I've taken differs a lot in combination with the way of wearing. Wearing it as a bracelet seems to be more inaccurate than the clip on way.

2017-01-24,"Love the look, love the simplicity of it, but it won't sync to my phone all the time. It randomly shuts off so none of my steps are tracked. I know this is a known issue with my smartphone, but I seem to spend a lot of time just trying to troubleshoot!",Love the look,3
